I am looking for a pencil
if I let go you will fall and hurt yourself
you went to Cambridge
it does not turn off
I do not think so
I do not have a pencil in there
I think that is still the sun
being stirred does not make you big strong and healthy
I never saw that before

you are tires
xxx espresso sing a song

part of the tape recorder
bring my purse
Adam he does not want to exercise
that is a good one to jump on
that is a porcupine
we will put them up now
maybe it broke Adam
Trowbridge Cambridge street
that is not a taper
it does not have a band
you have_to make a hole with something
it is a tape recorder
do not put them on the floor Adam
let us have something to read
that is a hippopotamus
that is not really a boy's book
this is a microphone
take a bath exercise play
I have something to read
maybe it is in here
this is a panda
he does not want pie
because his nose is very small and it just broke off
I am drinking espresso
it does not belong like that
he is finished

it is on the other side of the house
you had better take it back to Ursula
I do not know
a polar bear
and bring the pencils back too
he is sitting on top of ice
because you did not eat your breakfast
you go back in the living room
this one's the leopard
do not be so rough with the pen
you dropped your dollars on the floor
come on let us go
I did not take anything out
in the refrigerator so it will be nice and warm
Ursula took something out
I did not understand the word
careful of the light Adam
you do not have_to go to bed again
you fell down on Mommy's rug
I have some
at least not like that anyway
cowboy's got the boot on
do not hit anybody with that Adam
that is not chewing gum
I think you had better take the watch back to Ursula
you do it
you gave it to him
you might have_to screw this one a little more
play with cowboy's cigarette
that ca not be eaten
you have_to be careful or it wo not work properly
you dropped some under the table
for a ball
Adam fell down
do not be so rough
Adam let me see
it is getting big
that is not a ball
I think that is enough
Adam take the pencil out_of your mouth
he throws it up in the air
you hit your shoulder
that is good
on your knees
I will hold it while you screw
here it is
the small letter would fit in your purse
take the hat
I help to move rocks
he threw it up so high it did not come down
I think it is either a moustache or a smokestack
we could put this in the box
the song was daisy daisy
you do not have a mosquito bite back there
you write with a pencil
you are going to hurt yourself
today is not Thursday
I see some pennies that you dropped from your pocket
that is not a hammer
you like yours better
you do not use that either
that is for you
he is too small
you can look out_of the window
show your Mother and ask her if it is safe
I do not think so
there you are
take the pencil out_of your mouth
I see some pennies on the floor
playing the piano
careful of the tape recorder
that is the baby's too
I do not think so
do not hit your head on the bicycle
you play the piano with your fingers
there is not milk in here
come down or else you ca not player over there anymore
you dropped them
she has two raisins
there's ice in here
if you want it to go there
I do not believe that
food for growing a carrot
that is a good idea
I do not see your shadow
in the fire
are you all finished with that
look all around
branding a cow
you have not even tried it yet
I am not hurt
stop playing with Mr Cromer's pen

he does not see you putting any boots on
he has_to get it proper

hold your hand way up
turn it over
you are not putting any boots on
you ca not ride Perro
let me see the toy
that is for you
and say the magic words
it is not a blueberry
Adam you are going to fall
sleeping in the bed
I guess it is Shadow_Gay the horse's name again
Adam do not put that back there
I am helping you cut it
I do not see one
that is little Robin Red Breast
that is a flute
take your wrench out
let us see
Shadow_Gay a horse
close it and try again
do not let it spill
you write on the other side
it is for printing
I do not know
I do not think so
because then you would not have any to drink
you leave his pencil in there Adam
let me show you Adam
I do not know
turn it over
press it down like that
put it there and then you cut it
sit here on the side if you want to
I do not know the name for it
now rub it
do not put your fingers on it
give me your cup
there you are
do not put your mouth on the paper
it fits in the puzzle someplace
that is one of the men
he watches Miss Jean
that is his hair
you might hurt your fingers
press it down
that is enough
there are his ears
here's my mail from this morning
come on pal
you did not kick Perro

romper bomper stomper boo
and two eyes
letters the mailman brought
I see your back

they are all on the floor there
and a nose
you hit Mr Cromer with your shoes
I wo not
give me the button
that is good
those are shoes
that is a flute
it wo not come out
I think that was Paul dropping his pacifier in the other room
you are sitting on the cord
I have some
down by the bed Adam
that is his tie
must not write on the book
your books are over in your basket
I was just going to pull it out
you kicked him with your shoe
do not step on Paul's blanket
that is the button
you show me
and a necktie
it is been a long time
Cecile and Catherine
they are his baby+sitters
I was just straightening it out
you want him to kiss your dirty shoes
turn it around
that is mine
I did not think it was
you can ask Cromer if he will give you some more gas
you are talking about the cowboy
that is enough Adam
that is yours
it sounded like I do not think it would be Simonize
here's your pencil over here
I guess you have_to turn it around
careful of Paul
there's enough room for you to sit there
you come here honey and I will hold it
shame on you
you did not hang the socks up
you tell me
that one does not work that way
get up there and sit down
that one's different
it is under the chair
let us do some watches
you come show her
let us put the buttons back first
that does not belong on the floor
Daddy's Gil Smith talking about roadgrader
come and catch him
under the chair with your telephone
do not jump
so the baby can drink it
show Ursula Sandy's boots
you ask her
there's another pin on the floor there
I am sorry
I do not think that is yellow
I do not know
give it back to Ursla
ask him if he is finished
he fell over
here it is
you do not hit anybody with it
this one is for you
I did not think it was
just go around
this is your watch
do not do that
careful do not be so rough
you will bend it
that is Ursula's
look at this
if you want to drink it
and Daddy wo not like it at all
stop kicking me
you must not drive off until you get your change
it is not a pocketbook
do not step on it
I do not think that is yours
you rode over one piece
this is the toe
I though that was Adam's tow truck
just touch that
here's your paper and your pencil
ask me if I am finishes
you were playing with it and you spilled it
it does all the way through there
you lost a shoe
let her finish looking in her pocket book now
your washing machine
the other was something about Christmas and Adam eats peas
you did not cook anything
Adam you can ask Cromer if he is finished
I was crossing the street
make some breakfast
Adam come back
because it will disrupt the machine
ask him if he wants some more
I was crossing the street
I think it is behind the door
he is not a copy cat
it is hot
that is the way they made him
a picture of somebody
you are a copy cat
it wo not come out
because it will burn you
do not break the points Adam he needs that to write with
a book is not a ball
do not throw the book
there are so many things in here
you had such a funny expression
you will break it
are not you ashamed
I thought you said it was in there
you ask somebody to play with you
that is not a star
you are a funny one Adam
I think he meant let me play with Mr Cromer
do not put it on the floor Adam
you broke another wheel
hit on the bench
there it is
careful it got caught around the chair
these are sardines
that is for a baby doll
you are going to fall
not on the microphone
on the paper so you can see them
Adam will be home too
do not stand up on the chair honey
because you will injure yourself and you will hurt the car
do not break Mr Cromer's pencil
remember we do not stand up on chairs
I do not know
here it is
you scoot and get him
he wo not be able to write anymore
because it does not go if you break it
let us put them on the paper
we sit down on chairs
I guess he means ride buggy buggy
that was not a dime
I do not know
it does not belong there
I think they have enough air
he went to the mountains for the summer
this does not cut
that is fresh
that was a penny
do not forget to pay him
here are some more paper clips
I do enough tricks
it is on the floor
or part of the barn
maybe it is in this bag Adam
on the wall
I guess Cliffy looks at Bozo at her house
you do not drink cold coffee until summer time
turn it over and say the magic words
it is on the floor
show me the point
looks like Chatter
is that Mommy's change
put your finger on the point
I do not see any propellers on that one
that is not football it is basketball
some kind of bug
I do not know
you wo not have anymore tape
you fold them
that is part of the train I think
come on choo+choo
put the coffee cups back
fell down on his face
that is the point
your screwdriver is not straight anymore
I do not see any
it is a camera
I will hold them here
I do not know
you ca not take his nose off
you have_to ask Ursula
I do not think there are any games on today
he took the car to work

the green one
you ca not take his nose off
come at the end of the week
your hands are dry

you could drop the clothes+pins in here
trying to get the ball in the basket
cowboy fell down
put your hand down and get it out
see if it can fly
I do not know
the green one
you may be excused
I am looking for something
it must be the top to the sugar dish
that is pink
over towards the door
do not hit the table so hard
careful Adam you may pull the ironing board down
the other door
that is a duck
you say a busy bulldozer yesterday
do not pull on it
beep beep pencil
you fell down
yeah go on
the iron might fall
yeah pretend that that is water
I would not put it on with blocks in it
nose nose anything goes
he has his hand up to his chin
Twinkle says that
I have got a pen
I guess he meant behind
Twinkles the elephant
I am not hungry
do not hit his feet
he is swimming
I think he said slowly
he is going to wear that to the wedding
pens are to write on paper
he is going to a wedding
kangaroo let us see
you take it off
I do not want a spoon
that is not a hammer
you have_to unscrew this
it might frighten Paul
you go get it
do not break it
it is from David and Robin
pick up all the pieces and put them on the table
that is a donkey
there are two pieces under the tricycle
then you ca not hang anything
and a piggie
just pretend that you have coffee in there
you can do it even if you are big
you take a picture of Ursula
you are welcome
I will go get it
and snap it
you are going to fall with that tricycle
that is a little empty jar
that is clay
that is a man and that is a little boy
a street light
you already brought the supper
I do not think you can jump over the pipe
the table almost tipped
I do not think there's anything interesting for you in there
I have had enough
that is a man
you do not mean big
you are too little to do it
you two be quiet
that is a piggie
I had plenty
it is already
that is a little baby doggie
it already is
I have had enough
make this your table
the baby doggie is a puppy
you missed it
you are a big boy
that is a nice flute
pick it up and take it over there
looks like the head of a cow
I think the other one is in your wagon
that is very good
it is not the same dog as Pepper
a little one
ask Cromer if he can do it
with your elbow
that is not it
you are a nut
I just put something in it
little red spots
you will still hurt yourself
I am making a street light
press over the candle+stick maker
it is all_gone
Mommy does not wear a shirt
she will need another one
I guess he is working
I need something to write with
came from the dog
you ca not see it now
he has a dog named Spot
I need one
I need one
now put them on while it is on its side
it is gone down the street
I do not know
maybe you dropped it out in the kitchen
it is just from the rug honey
press it down
pretend you have water
shoes help keep your feet warm
that is a paper clip
here it is
give her one that is good
holding all the papers together
we do not want to lose the pieces
do not wake you up again
it has not finished
a moustache mhm
I do not think she is still in here
let us put the poor mailman's head back on
that is a beard
it says made in Japan
on the paper
press it down there
Adam sit down
that is a little one
do not ride on the briefcase
I need that
I do not think that is a derrick
yeah she needs that
I was just looking at it
because you hit it
if you like to
because that is the name of it
it looks like a crane
that is Ursula's
I do not know
do not push Adam that is not nice
it does not have nose
the top of the truck
I missed lots_of that
my_goodness Adam you tire very easily
that is Ursula's pocket book
Cromer says he thinks it is a crane
until your birthday time
you have_to take one off to put it on
now you can draw another picture
sounded like Thursday tow truck like that
I do not know it went up the street
give it to me
that is a train
she is gone home
the car is on the train
Adam you put it through the paper
she went home in July
it is gone to do a job
that is an armored car truck
Chocks are vitamins
look at the back of the paper
I am not waking you up because you are not sleeping
she did not say Chocks
you may break it there
now put it through
it is not doing anything
I do not think you need a fork
she said chalk
do not throw the ball

that is his eyebrow
that is not my hair+pin
Adam has a nose
that is a radiator
that is not a pin
that would hurt
I do not think he knows that
push this up
look at it
there is another one in the kitchen
put your finger on top of mine
I do not know
that would hurt
Adam's not funny
maybe she is afraid of doggies
you call them overalls
Judy and Buzz
I do not think I have ever seen anything like that
that is a couple we know
I do not know
that is an orange seed
I guess the owl has_to put them on himself
I am just trying to get the string off
I do not know
it is Goldilocks
I do not hurt myself thank_you
it does not belong on here
because they are
I do not know
do not write on your arm
write on the paper
xxx Perro is dirty
it does not belong on here
let me want fork
that is a tail
looks like a road
he does not feel like exercising
you are jabbering
that was a marvelous speech

they are made like trees
you are going to stop talking
you are going to feed the pigeons
you used to have a book about a tattooed man Adam
because I am Cecile
that is a plum
here Adam here's some more
do not look
let us do it on the table
bring your cup and I will think about giving you some
a car trailer truck yellow
I understood fire truck

do not push the microphone
she is going to show you something

you stay out there
see you can build it high
I do not wear mittens
you put it on by yourself
that is a ring
I would not take so many out
put it back in the folder
you hold the ring in your hand
Adam you give Bambi a ride
you try it
Cromer is not taking any out
I want you to tell her about this book
you put a little chocolate and hot milk
let us see
on your foot
just one minute now
I do not know
this is a raccoon
it was not dancing
looks like a square
do not hit the baby
I think you have had enough
you will hurt the little baby
it is a clown he said
he will cry
Adam are you writing
it is clown Adam
I think you had better ask your Mother
because they are on the river
take the pencil out_of your mouth
let us do some tricks
it needs another battery
they ca not swim
I do not think so
that is his tongue
I have some more
take the pencil out_of your mouth
I think this is called a bit
that is an address book

the racket is not up there
and come and turn this one on
give me the strong man
angry faces on the dial
take the pencil out_of your mouth
close the drawer
it is your home
that is a raven
that is fun
he wo not bite
he is a nice little horse
that is his nose
it is good for you
you ran into Mr Cromer's feet
I think these are called barbells
your tail hurts
do not sit on that
here it comes
are those pillows
they are very heavy
he could probably lift you up with one hand
is it another clown
you are typing
did you hit something
he has a nose too
that is a good one
you can bring your train over here and dump them
that is a round disk
put your other battery in
you ca not lift him up
I do not think Daddy wants his pillows on the floor either
the other way Adam
horsie has a nose too
you do it
I will have_to take the stick away
come and show her about the fireman and the policeman
we do not have_to
put together again

you have not see it for a long time
are you pulling your dog
I do not think there are any
I think you have had enough tea

I have plenty
I am going to wash his hands and feet
the other one
I already took some
that is enough now
if he is not careful
come on Adam
that looks like fun Adam

nothing happened to it
make it a little bigger Adam
I just closed the door

the other one
now he stands up
are you writing a letter
you are a big boy
look under the one
do not be so rough Adam
thank_you very much
you may break it
I think you broke it
Adam you let her look

they do not really belong over there
you will have_to go find that nickel and give Ursula that nickel
look at the horse
he needs that
I will write you a note then you can have one
very gentle with it
here's a pen for you
I do not want to ride in the back of the truck

it is behind you
sit on the front of the truck Adam and ride now
Adam I think you are missing your mouth
I ca not see

look at your shirt
take it back and find the other parts of it
I do not know
do not ride the roadgrader up there
he does not want his fingers popped either
that is a wolf
and get my pencil out first
she is waiting for her coffee
it is not a big hill

they do fly
a blue lion
it is very sticky
maybe he is looking at his music
you can take out the racing car
he is dancing look at this
you ca not see the music

it must be over here
we finished our game

I do not know
the sign says Adam Smith
like a punch+ball
are you writing your name
x to nine

to keep it closed
they do not really belong in there
you are very kind
it is a level
just like you
penguins ca not fly

Mommy ca not do it if you ca not do it
I think he said I do not like that stuff on me
it is very sharp
it is not time to sleep now
it is a little game
I just took a nap before I came
not on your leg on the paper
are not you ashamed
they will think you are just a little baby
took a nap just like Adam
I will turn it on
careful too cold to go in the water now
it is going to break
like Adam's horsie
I do not know that song Adam
you can make very funny people
you are not finished with that yet
I have a constant battle to keep him out_of a sweater
you sing it
I will pull something out
on his shirt yeah
not if you are careful
it is too loud
you sing it for her
you blow it
you sing it for her
let us turn it on here now
you have_to be careful not to drink so much
take a deep breath and blow
you want ta take your fifty dollars
is that a boot
it is just too noisy
they are the same
careful do not drink too fast Adam
I have an idea
you put your hand in
he ca not copy me
it is on
do not write on the couch dear
it seems to me that you tire of your games very easily
I do not care

that wo not hurt you
blow it again
that is a lock from a door
now he can close his mouth
you are looking for it
is that a ladder

I am not mocking you
Perro doggie horse
cross the bridge
they are not wet
I am not

he will come down backwards
I ca not wear that anymore
because some things are surprises
let me get started
I do not think you can open it
you do not need to pull it anymore
that is a good one
look like motor scooter
a paper punch
you put one on and I will put one on
I do not think you write with pencil on that Adam
good morning Mr Alligator
you broken the trains
rolling_steam is steam roller
you write with some crayons
I think it is too small to be trees

a big one

a sewing goes like that
you play with it that way
a saddle and a bridle
I say cock_a_doodle_doo
he says he is going to sleep because it is fourteen o'clock
you lost your cars
you left the others behind
you can have a pen
good morning to you

that is part of Daddy's barbell set
it is heavy be careful with that
you go get it
I mean put the paper on this
Adam is that a ball
those are palm trees from Hawaii
that is it
that is a nice story
you just rubbed on the bench
telling the same story
sometimes it hurts to do that
that is not a bat
they are so tiny
you ca not color them
sleep in the chair there
because they like to walk
that is not a lobster
you lost your caboozle
it is a crab
jump to the nurse
I am hungry for breakfast
Mommy ca not march
that is not Donald Duck
he must have had something in his bag
I did not think you did
I ca not have breakfast in bed
that is an egg
look at the chicken coming out
because I would get crumbs in the bed
the big one
maybe Catherine can march
Adam shall I get your scissors and you may cut some paper
you sound like Donald_Duck
it is really to measure things Adam
it is a band
because you spilled it
sit down here
do not scream
to hold it together
because you were not careful
wipe it off
I want some cracker crumbs and some seeds
because you were careless
I wo not fall down on you
they have a black leopard you can see spots under the black
you were careless
wait until you finish
I like to play with the children
he was playing a little tune
that is very nice
here it is
just a minute I need a pen from my purse
come on blow again
these are holding balls on their noses
because chickens like to eat seeds
you are a big child
so it wo not come apart
that is enough
you can use the table Adam if you want to
not Adam's mouth
that is the one that had an accident
because I am going to drink it
he is not a fish
he lost his ball
a parking lot
he is a little boy
because it is not good for little boys
sometimes he does
I think he may have lost it a long way away
a parking lot for cars
it was even made by Indians
I have some things
I do not know
you look and see if you can find it
if he takes them apart I take them from him
there are your Soakies
she is seen cars parking there
I do not know
look at the clown
so children can dress up to look like Indians
fish must swim in the lake
you do not eat racing cars
it looks like a house
I do not think so
mm this is good
I think there are some fish in the Charles River
those are monkeys
that is his head
is that hot
in the Charles River
you did not see the leopard
that is the little country doctor box
I think he is standing on his feet
it does not seem very sturdy
they are not Santa Claus
you may sit down and play and I will just wash
I do not think so
turn a somersault

she is standing on her hands
it is so small
I think it was a car
she like to play that way
I do not know
I do not know
you took it off
a doctor box
he likes to fix things that break
that is not a little boy's name
up at you
because there was something on there
those are horses
that means fun jolly
some people like to drive like that
maybe he parked it some place
listening to something
I do not think so
jolly means happy
there is one on
because Indians live in Africa
only they have_to be careful not to hit anybody
Tom Tom the piper's son
I do not know
just the horses' feet
I think they are marbles
you are about to sit in my chair like a boy
Adam you did not ask Ursula if you could open that

sit down dear
I suppose you can
because it is something he like to do
he ca not say Cecile

there are beans in there
that is a block
you go to the barber shop to get your hair cut off
you are jumping rope
I see it
they are not the kind that you eat
here it is
they are dried beans

he calls it cottage cheese
I will give you some paper

I do not know whether you need another one
is that a bat
I have had enough
you were drooling on the board

Kenny's at his home
I am looking for the cover to that pen
I do not know
that pineapple juice is so sweet
you missed somebody
I see two shapes that look just like that
I do not know
dust in your hair
I do not see it
they each wanted the wizard to do something
that looks like that
on the puzzle

Adam you had better put the cover on first
Adam you can turn it on the other side too
let us see if you know any of the number
Perro is home

pick the spoon up and just put it on the table
I see it
you can open one end

the kind the policeman carry
Adam is home

dirt is home
I should think perhaps it is
I moved the microphone
there's one of the cars over there
that is Colgate

bike is home

I would like to
look on the top line
Ricky's at his home

Susy is at her home
he uses the same construction for unlock
I do not know
we have_to attach it to this little hook
the diaper man
you do not run with a baseball bat
he says lock it off
dat a mother
you put the bat down and then you run
that is very pretty
we can make it round again
let her sit up there if she wants to
you missed again
I am taking out the tail part
you are a little lion
a treasure chest
it is so sticky
I do not see it
I thought you were going to eat the cheese
careful do not hit your head on the mantle
because she has_to write
you might break them
it is finished
that is nice
let us leave them in the marble box the basket
do not do that
I think you can take this piece out too
may be it is in the back
my hand is cold
you name it
somebody's gonna stay with the boy in there
hours of collection
this is his bottle on the stove
here's something we did not take out
take this piece off very carefully
you stay here with Ursula
I really do not know that
it looks like a wolf
that is going to be hard
these we put into here
there are his ears and there's his nose
I was talking to your Mother
I think you may knock it off Adam
it is very hard
we will have_to see some day
Ursula's at your home
these are wings and we are putting them into the clip
I am afraid we do not have any macaroni
little country doctor box
I ca not do it
do not hit my toe
I do not think you would intend to
Adam come back here
tape recorder's at your home
you have some on your tray
it will break
the firemen only can do that
Doctor Dan at the Circus
then you would not have any more Ursula
by the handle
you must have been so hungry Adam
here's some macaroni
I think we should leave that bridge down Adam
because you are a little boy and I am a lady
this is the wing
and another wing
meat and gravy
we are not men
from the bag
here's some milk
it is not a rope
it is like a rope
I am going to give you some
leave it on the floor Adam
it is a cord
they are tied
I am taking the end off
one two three four
go eat your crackers and drink your juice
there are some tiny cars in here
you pick doctor Dan up yourself
I had like some money gravy
I do not think you had like that
then they can attach by themselves
I was looking for the engine
a little girl with a pinafore
you have macaroni and cheese
you do not know
here is one
a little girl with a dress
a dog riding on a pony
do you like this book
tiny cars for a race
I do not think you need to play with a ball
it is not easy
I do not think there are any more pencils there
it is a beard
I do not know
that is not a train
here's something else to look at
that is a car carrier
she is the copilot
it carries cars from one place to another
you are going back under there
you have some here Adam
because Shadow_Gay drinks his milk
she helps drive the rocket
that is part of that one
especially new cars
is this the tattooed man
they are both in the same block
you are welcome
I do not know
it is a piece of wood
do you like the tattooed man
is that like your doggie
that is the landing tower
now you turn the propeller many times
night_night have a nice nap
he put his bread in his house
you had two lunches already
it is a sign
I do not know
did you find it or did Robin find it
I do not think that is the caboose is it
he has_to go back
xxx take it out
you try it
he caught his foot
now hold it up in the air and let go
they are going to fall off the line
not an ugly duckling at all
she has two
I see the caboose
those two are just alike
he is crawling around
maybe that is a vine growing on the tree
maybe one of my keys fits
these are control panels
you broke the boat
I guess he just likes to crawl
maybe that is a vine growing on the tree
I think maybe it came from your basket
that one's broken
she did not tell you you could look in there
another kind of racing car
it has someone's name on it
let me see
let us finish this first
I do not know
do not you peek then until you ask her
it is a Sky_Dart
a big giant
one has_to go this way and one this way
I do not think you can put it back
I will help you take one
fix the flat tires
I wo not bounce back
xxx to the post office
if you are careful
to the writing
the same way you put it together
you do not like coffee
I am breaking the stick that the motor of I made
here's a funny little spoon for your dinner
you did not put the gas tanks back on that truck
turn it over
I do not know
there are the things that you match on that side
that is David's last name like your last name is Smith
maybe it is there
I do not see it
we will pretend that is the caboose
that is very nice
the reindeer pulls his sleigh
it is not part of the apple
you want some macaroni
maybe you took it off
I just gave you some more
somebody can walk in
that is the driver's wheel
I do not know that story
you are a silly boy
here the tanks
I do not know
you did not have_to make her move
you are sitting on the others dear
you are a nut
Paul Adam's talking to you
I do not know
do not stop on her feet
I do not think he can jump through the hole
sit up so you may have another card
careful Adam with that pencil
it is not hanging on the line
you turn it
bottom of his boat
do it more until it is tight
it looks like a tank car
you did not guess
you had better be careful
do not put a hole in Bobo
he said one of your brothers
a squirrel might catch you so he had have something to eat
he did not think this key would work
perhaps she does not have any more
it is true
that is not your tummy back there
you can eat yourself if you want to
the keyhole in your door is closed up
so you can turn the train around in two places
here's some salt
let us take turns
I will put one on and then you put one on
I do not know
I should think that is hard
that is your back
if you bring me my purse
you are welcome
you do not have two tummies
you may take another turn
it is your turn
on the chair
your tummy's in front
it wo not hurt you
it is turning
you may ask Ursula
I do not think that is the way you put it in
there it is
I think you do it with screws and a screwdriver Adam
you have_to attach it with train tracks
look Paul look
he is got a book and in the back there's a game
I do not know
you had one in your pocket
I do not know
that is a marble bag
Paul caught it
poor Robin gets blamed for everything
the train track's in the box
can you find the following things on this page
he does not have a nose
you are just yawning
he said thank_you for the mouth
let us do it up here
it would be good to carry tiny cars
that is a space scanner
it is a support for the track
he did not give me anything
I took some paper from him
Adam you did not go to school this morning
you use it to look into space with
do not mash your finger Adam
not in that ear
that is not a bag car
and this is blast+off
I took it from him
it will hurt you
five four three two one zero blast+off
you just started playing with that
that is a space chart
I am just putting some things away
Adam you are just walking over her feet
I do not know
so we will have some space for walking
you could guess
xxx is put the whole bag down here
you could put it on your arm
whoo whoo whoo
you might break that off
you match all of them together that you can
that is a bouncing ball
you try and hit it with the paddle
here it is
must be a railroad crossing sign
you did not pick everything up
here's a piece of paper for you to draw on
that is to hold it
you did not have a cold
you can have it straight
look behind you
do not touch anything just look
park it over there near your garage dear
Paul is thirteen months
you had a sore throat
and here's the pilot
he is got his nose
wind it many times
I hear someone taking it from it
put it on the board
blow one more time
and there's blast+off
that makes it fly
I see it
let us put them all together first
I do not know
she has_to push it down so it will record
there's a pen there
I do not know
I wrote it down there
maybe to clean the track
if you sit down you can
this is the landing tower
because then you keep it from turning
it is my turn now
and someone has a glove
you pick it up
you must have broken it
it is made by Indians
your turn now
you probably stepped on it
so you should be able to read it
here's the bag on the floor
here's a clean one
Indians in New Hampshire
the other set of wheels must have come off
the razor blade
he means the razor
in the dream he was the cowboy
look Adam they are all singing and dancing around
perhaps the wheels are down in the box
it is for the pilot to get out
they are at a camp singing songs
that is a blow+out
neither have I
we saw it on Walt_Disney
I think you did
it is not a blow+out
she did not say that
he said thank_you for the flowers
it turns too
look on the second line
that is a pen
you put it in
I think so
pen for writing
do it on the floor first
do not tear it
hello said the bunny
it is very hard
put your lock in on the floor
get up here
your tummy is full
I was going to put this together
I do not know if I can
you have_to screw it
it was an accident
ask your Mother Adam
I do not know
I thought you said that was a propeller
I think perhaps it is the wrong way
be careful and do not lose the screws
that is five four three two one zero
the black tracks do not belong to the same set
so he can plant dem
you do not need that
so he can plant them
I do not think you need that either
I do not think they want to fight
I am afraid the horse may get hurt driving into a truck
I think they are friends
you said I could have the o
he does not understand
that was a big pop
they made them this way
he is too little to understand
that makes it longer so you can see better
this is the landing tower
you need to hold it up like this
I like roast beef chicken flowers
they are kissing
one house flying up in the air
perhaps there's a tiny one to go in the tiny hole
colonial I guess
Adam I think you do it on the other side
you will bend them
I do not know
I see things far away
you did so
it is a ruler
next_to the feet
I do not know
across the room
that is the water
he is happy
I do not think you have_to cut it
that is a g
the waves of the water
and the other one's a c
that is the copilot
across the room I see a tiny Adam
they are on the bed Adam
because we need that on the door
I do not think you need to color that
I said to myself
I heard it
something's wrong with it
the jeep is coming in
it already has a lock in it I think
that is a squeaky scooter
I do not know
the jeep is coming in
that is the place to attach the dart to the propeller
let us stop throwing them Adam
the car carrier
now put it down
a finger fish
it must be Robin's
they have brakes just like cars have brakes for stopping
a n t down
I do not think
at the other end
it is takes it
that is part of the lock
turn it over
I do not know
use that on the other side
I have seen a whale
that is the b
it thought your arm was a tree
you have_to go talk to Ursula
he is crying
he is sad
you almost stepped on your finger
in a book
you did not hold it up high enough
they are more than numbers
you turn it around
a finger toe
you ran over a bean bag
I will hold this
there it is
I do not think so thank_you
they are directions
then you hold it here and here and let go
because you were laughing
because I wanted to know
he went for a walk with his mother
those are sunglasses
that part of the n goes there
put your screw back in
it is a patrol car
I see somebody's name Adam on the
I can make you another spoon
Adam Gilbert Smith
careful so you do not hit your hand
now you do it
I think it is just skinned a little
r o b i n
you use that on the green side
this is yellow
you have_to watch out for Paul's fingers
before you go
hold it straight
and he had lots_of friends
you can put them on
now try this one
kit or box
look in there
you either use the chalk or the crayon
see if you can get your spears onto the bed
I do not think so
on the other side
you were sleeping before he went to sleep
I see my Harvard shirt
that is not a Harvard shirt
I do not know
you lost some germs from dirty hands
you have sand on the floor
we have more things to play with
keep that foot on there
all of it
I think perhaps something is missing
I do not know
put them in front of you
and then draw some more
I do not know
here's something else
those are tweezers
you see the wood of the hammer
that is a strong rubber band
it looks like a friendly animal
you try those
for picking up things
horses should have a barn
I asked you first
I do not know
I do not know either
I do not know
he is talking to you about something
like a Jack_a_weasel
not really we just bought a loaf of bread and some eggs
you did not play much with it
here's a butter knife
and then went to the park
played with toys sang some songs etcetera
you do not
it does not fly all by itself
let me see
you help it by turning the propeller
fixing my beads
now push yourself with this foot
you have_to come back here
I do not know
I just do not think that Paul is interested
I just fixed my beads
just like you use the crayons
I had like to know
that is not a nice noise to make inside
it is something you have seen
with the pencil sharpener
just sitting here waiting for you to finish your water
it is a good thing they had their seat belts on
I have never seen Mr Pickle
it is so hot that you should be extra kind to everybody
come on let us finish the train
I do not think that was a worm
I think there's a piece of cheese on your plate
I think that was a snake maybe
do not knock the tray over
you have got one
here Paul give the horsie some sugar
I put it away
you are really getting very tall Adam
in my purse
with your brother
find another game
my_goodness that car sure is pulling something big
over in your basket
in this purse
waiting for you to finish your water
a little boy named George
she has_to write
there's your over there
so I may put your cup up
you can keep it
because you had it in your pocket
on the dresser
he wants you to play with that
that is for you
it is called a birdie
it ca not really walk
so_that you would not break it
let us look in the book
now it is all folded up
it is just a toy snake
you drop it
yours went on the bed
it is just a toy snake
it is Kenner
because it has_to be put up
it is a toy company
I do not know
this is the bow
the little girl
pulling the trailer
play with it
her name is Sheila
try to get it back
that is not tennis
that might break
you go over there and play
not today I do not
this part looks like it is had an accident
that is a funny name for a kitty
those are fish
this is for Paul she said
I did not hear a motor boat
I have an a b c book
careful Adam you may break your airplane
look at it carefully
we were sitting in chairs and we went out
they fit you
I was not looking
Adam let Paul try this
maybe we can read it together
look at it carefully
I thought you were putting them together
you drank it all
I did not hear you ask her if you could open that
this is a bucket loader
ask Ursula if that is it is
I do not know
this must be the letter a
like a mitten
that is a funny name for a rocket ship
maybe David did
maybe I have something for an arrow
you tell me a story
careful Adam you will break the box that way
you sing me a song
one of the tinker toys
here's one more baby
after you open it
I should think so
because they like them
stop crying Paul
look at that
you knocked it down
it is another ant
it fell on that on that part Adam
Captain Bob has one of these
it is a drink you mix
it is not broken
Paul has never seen his face
they are too small
we have_to we has_to get out our trucks
because it is the custom in their country to eat snails
put it together and then show Paul
it had a handle
it wo not go very far
I do not hear it ticking
those are bright tone crayons
he will like that
turn them this way
he is not going to sleep
throw on the bed Adam
these sounds all sound like b
that must be a special kind of horse
pick the one you dropped on the floor up
you and I
Adam you could draw some pictures now
I just put water in it
it does not have an arrow
turn them around
way down to Boston
Robin has some arrows at home
I do not know
you will have_to figure it all out by yourself
a wheelbarrow horse
xxx there's a balcony on the next floor
good night dear
maybe if she wants to
on the floor downstairs
I think they should keep going down Broadway street
you get his clothes and then put his clothes on
I threw mine on the bed
you do not have a mailbox up here
do not put them there
let us play over here
her beds are at her house
someone might sit on them
I am asking you
I guess the hitch is broken
maybe I might sit on them
this is last night day
you did not
let us put Jocko together
that is a dairy
that is very nice
and then we will look at some books
that is the dairy
maybe Ursula brought some of Robin's books
because you need to have your nose wiped
some of the paper is black
let us put the puzzle together and pick it up first
it is a bug
go over there
watch those fingers
Milly is a friend of ours and she spent the night
it was a snake
let us not throw any more
because we need to use them
you were born in America
I do not think you have ever seen that before
it is a shell
the yellow black thing
he is been to school for one day
because you hurt Paul
that was just an accident he said
it sounds like the ocean
it is cactus
a dozen of eggs
all the others have their own color
it is a sea shell
this is d
two cowboys and one baby
I am not sure that it does anything with the bee
that is the top
I thought was Ricky
because Shadow_Gay spanked him
because your mother and father live in Boston
here's another microphone
you need to put the wheels under both holes
they are going to sleep in the Wintertime
you can put it in here if you want
on the other side too
now you fly it Adam
Paul Adam is putting Jocko together
fell went over you
because you put it on there
then we can look at some of Robin's books
the other side now
some little sea creature was in there once
I do not really think they come on or anything
I am too big
this is for little boys
he has a new little big trailer
put it in the hole
you let Bobo hear it
an airplane fell on your little brother
you fly it
you have_to put it up very close to your ear
you do it first
there's one more piece
I do not know
they are taking baths
this is not a doggie
it does not seem to
I think that is a different train
you are pushing Paul
sleeping in the bath
Adam now do not bother him anymore
they do not burn it down
a kitty's name
Robin had a white mouse
you mean stop the noise
he went way over there to play by himself
Adam bend that other little piece up on the back
a real one
one that crawls around
do not tear her stockings
it just plays nice music
because that is the way it is made
take a guess
you had it upside down
from the ocean
you have a giant coming through the city of Boston
look in the other end Adam
Robin has a little cage for the mouse
that is something you like very much
there's another truck
turn it over
turn them around
you will have_to talk to Ursula about that
bunny rabbits also like that
that is pretty good
a sixty Rambler
I put it away
to put the fire out
do not run doctor you might fall and hurt yourself
these are dragon flies
because he is easier to take care of that way
you are too big
then the building burns down
I think so too
you put your foot like the policeman we saw
those are dragon flies
now you have_to lead the trucks
in my purse
he is hanging out_of your pocket
do not run little boy
that is a donkey
he wo not bother you
it is just a toy it ca not crawl
on the side
all those little things there
you might fall and hurt yourself
there it is over there
this is the letter e
he is all tired out
they do not build buildings
let us see if I see you
look at it carefully
perhaps you can find out
I do not believe that
that does not come off dear
these are tusks tusks
I think it would be much more fun if you find out
his name is Rinny from Rin_tin_tin
a b c
it says stop and go
because you took them out
a is for acrobatic alligators in airplanes
see he is just playing honey
he ca not talk yet he does not have a mouth
for the cars that are waiting to cross the track maybe
that is an eggplant
that is part of the puzzle the vegetable part
for his checkup
he does not want to chase you
they put the fire out
do not throw them
I thought owls sleep in the daytime
it started Monday
the wheels ca not get in
we will see one next time we go the grocery store
you look very carefully
he does not want to bother you
let us go find Perro
I do not think so
I do not know
to put another fire out
one talking at the microphone
I do not know if it is that way
just the dairy products around here
putting the fire out at the school
because they have a factory
see the eggs the milk the butter
I do not know really
here it is
not your garage
of the book
I do not see them
about to wake up
he does not have any arms
and then we saw the derricks tearing the school down
that was my garage
Adam you hurt his feelings
you took his block
he might hurt himself on this
if you turn one they all turn
you did not
do not have an accident now
potato you know
I do not know
because they are all linked together
call Robin doctor
this is f
try to write with it
call Dr Robin
there are some seals
c is for chimpanzee
the hitch was not on properly
now you can make dinner
you do not want it to fall
he is the color of grass
you left these out
and he hops
I do not know
I was just putting them on there
he said I want that
there they are
I see a cat
I do not know
some more things for supper
he sees something back there that he would like to have
with the pen
do not hit Paul on the head
I did not know you knew these in the book
do not pull the microphone any more
I think that does not go there
write your name
we rode in a taxi and you sat in a chair
on the board
that looks a little like lettuce
I did not say that Adam
do not step on Paul's toesies
that was the bean bag and the boat too
that is different
careful Adam you do not want it to break it
the cabbage does
this goes down in there and then you close it
because it is in too far
you do not have any milk on that truck
I have finished my lunch
the boat was back there
that might hurt him
look at all the nice things
this is the letter h
the truck you are driving
here's a piece that is not broken
you are a silly silly boy
you have_to put one up before you can put the other down
that is all
if you wish to
you need some more track
your tongue hurts
it wo not stay
I am giving these to Paul
two seals one strong man
we are playing a little game
here's a piece
he is just laughing
one bareback rider
I do not know
he is happy
you find out
and a train
stay on top of the ball game
a circus train
he has blocks too you know
he is probably frightened of people
you put the string in here
it is a fruit basket
put it under the bridge
something that a king wears on his head
let him have one block while you build your building
he is a hungry baby this morning
it needs another piece of track
a green stamp basket
you are not supposed to turn that
it is not balanced like that
that is very good
I do not know
she showed you one time
that looks like a hen
I am afraid you are going to break it
I want some
he is he is finished
cackle cackle cackle cackle
he did not mean to hurt you
Paul was watching and his head was going up and down
this is my building over here
I am too big to jump through that hole
I had like four quarts of milk
this is one of Robin's favorites
Paul look at the telephones
d is for dolls
I have not seen Shadow_Gay in a long time
green stamp basket
e is for eggs
brown and white
look at that egg
four quarts of milk and two pounds of butter
because they were painted that way or made that color
the hole is too small
I did not knock mine down
that one does
that is a lumber company truck
see it is still up
it is a hill
so I see
tuner for a violin
now pull it
Adam you look so tall
I thought you said something about Italy
I did not bring one
you will cut your little fingers there
perhaps it is a basketball instead of a football
and your bunny
he is just a little baby
I do not know
maybe he is surprised
I am out
that is his hair
watch the propeller Paul
a puppet on Miss Jean's show
f is for flowers and frog
I am out
g is for giraffe and girls
I only have two
I did not say I do not have it
that is his hair
I said four quarts of milk
I do not think it is sharp
Paul can you say airplane
you have_to ask Ursula
Adam is playing with the airplane
Paul Adam wants to know if you can say airplane
you put them anywhere you want to on the other side
if you dial that one this one ought_to ring
my name is funny
a board or drawing board
just punch it out
perhaps one should be down and one should be up
let us put this one on
I guess so
that page is gone
this is your house
just open the flap and you will see
just the way you put the track on look
they might spill like that
look at it carefully
that is a rhinoceros
put yours on
I like it so I had like to paint on it
it is hard
it fell apart again
it is a very long wire
it says gobble gobble gobble
let us move it over so we have more room
look and see
we went swimming nearly every day
so_that they will grow
I will punch some of it
I do not want any butter that might fall off the truck
you can draw on the board
Paul Douglas get off those books
it is jelly or jam
maybe we should set this
that is the name of the toy
seals and fish
you have got the two dozen eggs on properly
because it does not have a motor
Shadow_Gay riding a pony
that is a jug
that is a k
this is one of your tinker toys
a bowl of ice+cream
let us see if it still stands up
you are silly
they are on properly
if you say so
they wo not fall off and break
do not want to show him
perhaps she knows
I like to bake cakes and cookies and I need butter
Hop on Pop
let him play it too
except I think it is supposed to be at your ear
you buy them from the grocery store
and I like to have toast and butter for breakfast
I will get you some water
here's another one
perhaps he just popped out
Adam maybe your fire engine will stay on better
k is for kittens
this is the landing wheel
I do not think that is ever going to stay on
after you get up in the air it fold back
good for you Adam
you have so many pencils
just my two pounds of butter
ice+cream for boys and girls
there are so many
in the airplane
now pull it up
here are two
maybe you could tie it on
it is a lobster
here's another one Paul
go in the airplane
I do not know Mr Milkman
I do not know
I am not sure you can put them back
I might have_to get another milkman
it looks like an x
I guess it is misplaced
somebody was laughing
they do not fit on that set
it must be lost
I do not think he can go in the airplane
you lost my butter on the street
here's your pencil
a witch you thought
just a tiny part of the petal
Adam take out a few at a time
I do not think that is a turtle
she is knitting
he wants his car honey
I would not laugh about that
you just kid me all the time
you lost your footie ballie
that is a lobster
they are too heavy
I have never seen a kangaroo knit either
he was playing with this one
that is a lizard
I like apples
perhaps it would stand up too
put it on your middle finger
you did not have any car
the other way
I am hiding Adam
they ca not carry you anyplace
you are a donkey pulling a wagon
I think over
I am sure we can find a car in here
l is for leaping ladies and leopards
cookies and grapefruit
I would not know
let us do this page first
you hit his finger
because it is easier to do I think
I think you hit his finger
in_case you need it
it is in the drawer
because I am going to put the door on
do not do that anymore
he is sleeping down in his bed
you are guessing
she wets my hair
with a merry+go+round
those are nickels
I need lots_of milk Adam
push one up
I do not see the puzzle
turn your paddle over
I do not hear Paul
I hope it does not come out
because those are pretty colors
it is a mermaid
so they wo not fall out
see if you can hit it again
do not do that
I guess he was new at the job
talking I suppose
tangle means put it back like it was
that is her tail
I do not think so
you might break it
let us have marbles
it is not a real airplane
you have one of those
he is giving you the other one
then I will be happy for two of them
that is nut
you should have three up
that is a very long number
he did not really knock it down
this is your mixing bowl
just a minute sir
I ca not look for dese sticking out
do not do that
I do not know
Paul would like that
not three more
let us see
you might hurt yourself
you put yours on
the drum is out there
make it look like that one
because the knots came out
there is not a puzzle this morning
he likes to ride in the lake
you ca not sit on Paul dear
it is a q
because the knots in the string came out
he is not quite big enough yet
you saw one on television this morning
I do not know
let us do the puzzle
I think you have got one too many
you get it
I tied some knots in the string and they came out
you rolled it over there
you have finished
that you just put in
I do not know
in the water this morning
they just left this
it is just not in here
maybe on another page you will use the other ones
this is a q with the little thing sticking out
one two three four
it is just lost
that is a nurse
they did not take this off
n is for nurse
I am not mad at you
put it back
let us see
perhaps they are just taking their nap in a nest
one two three four five
once upon a time
you come and look Adam
Paul Adam say it is your turn
that is a plug an ear+phone plug
o is for opera
then wind it up again
we ca not hear you with your fingers in your mouth
that is just something extra
you take Paul's turn because he ca not do that
come and look
I am putting this in there
you hold the key
I do not know
I am watching
I do not think anything did
you will have_to ask Ursula
count each one only once
I think you could
that was a nice story
pull the string up
you could use another one
you were born with lips
it sounded like part of Red Riding Hood and somebody else
count this one
you are sitting on a quart of milk
she ca not see it
do not run over Paul
two three four five six
it is an orchid
Mr owl and Mrs ostrich
you can take the fire truck out
a pound of butter and a dozen eggs over there
and they are watching Othello
there are lots_of blocks in the basket
Hercules the fire engine
a b c
maybe you just have_to push it on Adam
it is an opera
this is six over here
you stay down here
make it look like that
you knocked my glasses off
you hit the side of the chair
because he likes to put things in his mouth
a chatty doll
make it look like that
these are houses
I did not think you had notice
you do not throw blocks you know
you mean a stethoscope
p is for parasol
a bulldozer does not fly
I think Paul would like to see you
like a doctor has
it does not have any wings
your automatic rifle
you may make them ski just two at a time
let us see if I hear something
I had like one quart of milk
I do not know
I heard a little click
I knew you did not know
you have_to go get some from the basket
and a dozen eggs
Paul stand up
one dozen eggs
Adam wants Ursula to see if you can walk
I think one did break in Cambridge
go fill this box with blocks
I was walking rocking on your leg
here's another one
you may break it and it is Paul's
it does not need to have a top
did was it be a comb
now all the shiny cars in a line
try to get your room straightened out
let Paul have that one with the light
that is a light
because you will be careful
I do not know
you took them all down
you are not big enough to play that game
you could try it that way
maybe we can attach it to two chairs
shall I tie it from here to here
let us try it again
you will so
Adam do not break it dear
I think you do
I do not think it has a top
she is married to a king
because it is not yours
yeah it is a lady
that is only one car
it is your turn
maybe Ursula uses that
those are not letters those are numbers
wait a minute
I found a penny on the floor
there's a quart of milk
to write letters
you paste them together
close it up
you could use it
over over on the sewing machine
you are too big
you can make a bracelet with paper clips
let us find a king
she said you may use it
that was long ago
do not do that
q is for quintuplets quilt
I do not suppose he can catch it
you will hurt him
there's a horse for the ballerina
you make part of it too
I think not
because he is small
you need a pencil
do not knock me
I will bring some handkerchiefs
let us hang some Kleenex up
it almost shot the wall
you have_to sharpen it first
you hold him down here and squeeze and it makes him jump
you are all wound up like a snake too
we have not done this page
two pounds of butter
put the wheels on the train
fishes swimming count all ten
these are the fish
he has feathers
you squeeze and then let go
if he falls like that he will lose some of his feathers
on the pencil
let that be the door
the point is the part of the pencil that you write with
except you are sliding in my trash
that would be very funny Adam
there's one behind it
the same thing that you said
that is a good idea
while you are doing that I will take Paul
here's another one
r is for restaurant
that is a good idea Adam
that is for that one
because that is the way a snake has_to move
it took Robin a long time Adam
I can understand myself
two quarts of milk
he winds himself up and he straightens out
I hope so
that is a nice white wash
count them before they run away
you ca not just use one hand
two quarts of milk
you have_to use two
because he is holding on by his hands
that is just a shell
there we are
he has just one baby
it is shaped like a snail
I will have the green one
that Cecelia gave him
fill it all up
he is bringing it out and putting it on the table
and he gave his mother his milk
now fill up this part too
move the tricycle over here out_of the way
I am waiting for you to put the other door hinge on
if he is not a snapping turtle
now do the edge
an elephant in a train
you throw it
you have_to look and see
I think you have just one car
I do not know about that
there it is
you play over her
I guess if you wanted to
you have two kitchens
he is writing your order down with it
you throw first
Adam we forgot to bring that flag home from nursery school
here's a turntable you have not even put on yet
pull it out and see
there's a number one
twenty homes are here in this town
because you are talking and I could not understand you
so he can come very fast
he knocked the pig off and ran over the goat
that is a number two
two red counters up all green counters down
just like Captain_Kangaroo's ballerina
you look like a Chinese princess
you do not do that
I think Paul wants one Adam
that is green
he is a dangerous driver
you have_to turn it
you have eighteen there
all of them
a blonde wig
I think she
I just put some out here
bring the box
you let the marbles drive
eighteen sheep inside the gate
you stand up with some legs
it is a wig
here's number eight over here
red counter one green counters eight
it is somebody you know I think
you give him two of yours
fill it in
not really he is just trying to use me for a ladder
I almost sat on Paul he moves so quickly
look at this Adam
fill it in
because it is so big
I think he is getting some molars
I like this
I do not know
do not put your tongue out like a snake
with your pencil
I do not think you need your train
playing with your bunny
that is a funny one
you are not big enough to play the game Adam says
you have got that train
careful Adam do not get on his fingers
he does not have one yet
let it rest on your head like that
look at it again
like a water moving machine
I do not think that is sixty four
that is only two wheels
now we are all finished
xxx broken finger
one two three
we have_to ask permission first
your shirt and pants do not meet
you do it by yourself this time
now you blow through the hole
some little screws in
they wo not fit either
dirty dirty fingers
I am sorry
maybe we need a new page
I was just happy because you were doing such a good job
in the binoculars
he does not want to throw
she is handing you something
you said it was an a upsidedown
I will throw it for him
you may break the crayons dear
I do not really know that they are screws
I do not know
that is the way he fights
however it is put together
just put your mouth on there a little
that is the way he has_to get his food
I do not think you need to take it apart
do not cover the hole
one more we need
do not do that Adam
so_that he wo not forget
if he is in a cage
he said a toaster
it was a v
you can make designs with them
I do not think they will go in there
because it might run over some of the animals
perhaps his Mother bought them for him
there are so many
there it is
let him look honey
here it is
Adam you are silly
it might hurt the animals because the tractor's so big
up here on your dresser
he thinks he is grown a little
there's an h
Adam was going to bed and he saw it
I need a new one
blow very gently
I was just doing this
I will wipe it off
you almost did
look at that little boy in the mirror crying
because they are just babies
this one does not look like all the others
a little one
it would not fit me
just like me
I usually sit there
I am a little too big
come away Paul
looking at the little boy
a real bird
there's a heater over there and it is blowing in his face
it looks the same
let us do number nine
put it back up there
take it off
you can put them in all different directions
if you blow gently I think you will get more
I see it
careful do not put those letters under there honey
you may break that
hold it down with one hand and pull it with the other
always squeeze from the bottom
do not put it in your mouth
put it up on the dresser
your Mother did
in the mirror
Paul is playing with the trailer because you had the barn
you do not need to throw your arms up to blow
it is a part of the police car
I think they say the face
it is a movie camera
I suppose that could be here
I need three quarts
you did not miss
a movie camera
shake all your keys inside and then just push down the snap
it is a nice kitchen
mine had a hole in it
I do not know
Paul he is looking out the window
I do not know
I did not see you
remember in your book
that is enough being silly
sometimes they catch them and eat them
this way it is not
that is not three
I think it is Chinese
I may look at them in the kitchen
I should think you could find a parking space almost any place
that was an accident
to the door
if you want to
he was talking about President Kennedy
you will have_to grow a little
here's some more
I need another milk thank_you
story about George Washington
put it on
more rubber bands there
here's a little hole
whoever read that story to you
I am finished with this one
because we could not find the key to fit it
let me find a mirror so you can look at yourself
you are getting open the whole thing
m is here
I see something on that picture though
you call it an egg beater
you fill that in
blow it up in the air
you should not have hurt your little hand
he can see
do not put it in your mouth honey
Adam I hear something over here talking in your farm yard
keep your finger down
you had like to give Adam one
let us have a t
it is medicine
you can do this part
quack quack quack quack quack
you do not have_to stretch them very far
she is going to fall in the water
let us have a race
because it was so pretty
I do not know
turn it the other way
do not put it in your mouth honey
just a minute
quack quack quack quack quack quack
I do not think so
you saw some at the circus
yesterday he said something that sounded like Tallahassee
I will get it started
I think he makes up his own newscasts
designs are different shapes of things
they are having a picnic
quack quack quack quack quack quack
we had a halloween party
mine did too
it does not taste good does it
mine did not
I do not have any
wait my finger's caught
there were two other ones
not on there
I hear something saying gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble
must be broken
Paul sees that one
that is Ursula's
it is a cough drop
so two people can play
you said this was mine
must be broken because they fell from the truck
your horse is for riding Adam
David had just the same
two motor boats
blow gently Adam
gobble gobble gobble gobble
that is very good tea
it is all_gone
after the seals leave I am sorry
that is so you can put it in your pocket
it is a microscope
open the whole thing
a genie back
let us see
I need that though
I do not think he will let me
I had so much
you help me
hiss hiss hiss
I need to write
mine is so much larger than yours
thank_you very much
do not break it anymore dear
maybe it is in the bag
here's one over here
I do not think she really walks
we bug just bug
I ca not see
I do not close it properly I guess
put them around here
the part that comes out_of the blower
you just have_to get the paper off
a design does not have_to be something
look at his feet
it can just be a shape that you think is pretty
you just heard it
that was the cat
whales are far far out
do not put that so far
so his feet wo not get cold
you are getting it
oink oink oink oink
I do not think those sound do t
you will be on the cord
I think Paul put one on
you can use that ball for bowling
I do not know
you put water in there
Adam I think Mommy broke the dolly
you say that is six o'clock
I like a nice clean backyard
because that is a nice place to go
broke the leg off
he wants to play with you Adam
I put glue on them
they are for you
lift it up a little while you are pulling
that is the nipple and other is the cover
one day we will get some and make them
he just had a nap
that looks like a piece of rug to me
you know like the one Dr Sherry gave you
I am sure it must be on
those are all the same colors
maybe it gets stuck on the end
that will too
he will put it in his mouth
that is a rubber band
put them in the dairy
that is five minutes after five
we were doing a train track and then you stopped
careful you will put a hole in it
because that is for a doll
do not kick it too hard
maybe that shoelace is not very good Adam
there's a little left
I do not see a Volkswagen
he is just a little baby
that would make a nice hat
you do have a camera
you might break something
she ca not hear your head shake
that is a microscope
that is very good
if you say so
I do not think you can get it in your pocket
under your rolling pin
I thought this was a station wagon
it is a microscope
you put it together
you have_to put it back in the bag
I will make one if you like
let us see
because he went up so high
he did not play with anything this morning
perhaps they leave the blinking light on too I do not know
he went to sleep this morning
because he likes to
I think this is a cake knife
look through that little hole in the microscope
he is just bouncing a little on the seesaw
now you will have_to pick them up
because that is fun
these are germs
it is a recorder
he was playing with the cow
do not catch cold
dirty water germs
a water fountain
these are germs from dirty hands
there it is
t is for toast and tea
this is not a knife
do not xxx
playing the banjo
I put them up last time
it is a fork
these are fingernail germs
he can play two
this is a real microscope
those are germs from dirty faces
she turned the direction so she could hear better
you put them up
germs from dirty ears
I do not know
he is telling a story
it is such a small kitchen
careful do not push him down honey
careful of the cord
a cooking set
that is the strange odor you smelled
we need a small mirror
you said you have a stove Adam
it looks like they are dancing around in a circle
I will tie your shoes
let us put them all in one place to start
do not play with the record
I do not know
put them all in there
shame on you
he is growing
there's one over there behind you
do not knock on the window Adam
that is a bag for going to call on people
so they wo not be so stretched
you can move it anywhere you want
you take that one I will keep this one
Adam do not push him down honey
that is your bunny with the funny name
it is stuck on your pants
you can change the shape
I will let it cool
you can pretend to be a doctor
a rolling caterpillar
you could wear it for a bracelet
we need something to look at
a snow man
I did not finish that one
it is a pan
we could use a hair
that dolly was made in Italy
I will hold it while you put your down
that is question mark and that is a question mark
for cooking things
Paul Adam already has them
because we are going to look at it under a microscope
put this back first Adam
that is the pan for cooking
not up in the tree
something to drink
because it is a book of riddles
a frying pan
let us try one of these
I ca not make dose h
here's a quart of milk over there
I thought that was a tuner
you do not have_to make it
I mean with these
I did not bring him
Adam you did not put your cough drops in
that you are playing
u is for umbrella
he came by himself
to be sold in the stores
you have_to look
sing a song
he came in through the open door
she blew one up
we need some help
look on the unicorn's head
box he says
I do not have any sugar
sing a song about a tuner
let him look at one
that is very kind of you
they are so smart because they always go around in schools
of the unicorn's horn
I did not know that airplanes had a horn
Paul I do not think she needs your help
she knows Ursula
you said beep beep
you had an accident
they are part of rabbit
your train fell off the track
I do not know
these go back in Ursula's bag
they are part of big rabbit
you have had enough
I do not like shooting
you can press the button on that microphone
I had a visitor
except for the key case
these are things you can make
let us see if we do it this way
that is a tuner for a violin
I do not know
you could keep that
under the sofa
you have_to take them apart Adam
Jack fell down and broke his crown
I do not know
this is a humdinger
that is a pad for washing pans
look at that
he comes on on Sunday
do not put it so far in your mouth
you have a broken leg
a centipede with sore feet
it is a little hard
careful do not break it
take a guess
do not pretend like that
you ca not do that
that is enough Adam
he ca not hold that much
I have a little printing set
I think there are some old books there that are all torn
you have a street light
about a funny dog
a chewing boy
you have_to stop Mr truck driver
count them again
I think I have enough fish now
look at it again
you did a long long time ago
now put this back in the bag Adam
I found one that you missed
w is wedding walrus and whales
here we are Adamy
because you are a little boy and little boys break things
there are some more
a red light
it is the ink pad
you just take little children's temperature that way
it is a box of quackers
you may go
Diandra Paul had that
different things different shapes
mhm that people bring
just leave that in Adam
I take my temperature in my mouth
because it was in there
I do not know
be very careful with this one
you may have it if she says so
turn it over and press it down
make this your stove
you certainly do talk a lot
because that is the way to play the game
I do not know
take your time
I think so
this will be your kitchen
I will cook them tonight
they are there so you can open them
do not throw it dear
let us see if this is as tall as you are
the center pole is wider on one side
and the dog got frightened of the big bull and backed out
they are already up
do not put it in there Adam
you have_to turn it around so_that it matches
you may forget it
they are really having a vacation
she has_to take them back home
I thought you were going to make some letters
this is an x_ray
this is green
because you broke it
green like the green light
I have put some up
let him have those Paul
do not step on the book honey
you have_to pull it all the way down
very good Adam
I am waiting Mr Milkman
I am sorry I wrote on you Adam
I ca not see cowboy hat
I think you have_to look toward the light
I will pretend
I do not think he could really swallow those things
look at that stretching
you are heavier than Paul
let me see
I do not know
you might hurt him
here comes Dr Adam
that is just a little story
we are going to have fish
he is crying because he lost his dog
it is a car horn
he did not even cry
I had like to see it
it sounds like the horn is stuck
you knocked down as many as I did
Paul would like to see it
a funny cartoon
you put one out first
y is for yaks in your yard
see if you can put it on top of there
it is about Hector
the stow away pup
you have_to match it
you had like to cut them
let Paul see this one
I will get some scissors
you do not need to pull this all the way down
it would not be safe to leave it standing like that
let Paul have one
he dropped your crayons
it may pop
we need something like a shoelace to spin it
so_that it wo not fall on anybody
that is a Creepy Willy
Diandra Paul had that
some soup and some juice
just a little girl
there's one in there under your bed
the box is on his arm
and some hamburger
you go this way
because his name is Willy and he creeps
because it is closer
z is for zither and zebra
you let the whole model go
I see more than four
I thought that was the store over near the window
you give it a name
yours went under the play pen
we have finished
wait boys do not tear the book
she is a little girl
I will put yours up and you put mine up
you did not do very many
I do not see any peanut
you pull this back
hello hello Paul
you let it go after you get it all the way out
it does not stay
you dropped xxx
you dropped them
here are two
he does not want a little piece
I see another one
this is my refrigerator
I will try
maybe it ran away
now come over here with it Adam
the milk broke too
over near your roller
not in your mouth
you go first
it is called a t+square
I do not know
I am going to tell you
listen to his back
I had like brown
you almost did it
you can look
I do h
this is Rocky
just an accident
it is not a ball
a dog cake
Adam let me put it in so it is straight
Paul would like red
see it goes in so_that these teeth fit around this part
that might swing off
I have never had any dog cake
I think that is nice that you are not crying
on roller skates
now let go
somebody named Linda
he is working with his father
somebody named Linda
that is very pretty
you are going to do it
he is making something
a big fish
a dog cake must be a cake for a dog
I was thinking of a funny story
doubly doubly with gum
he was supposed to be setting the table
I think it is on the other page on the back
you forget dose dollies
mine says p a u l
now hold on to the handle and pull hard
double your pleasure
look at the things you can make
me said t v e i l
that is a small fish
you do it
hold back a little further
p u i m o
some for my little baby and Ursula
this is Paul's name
you saw that on tv
I saw something through here
I guess not
it is so small I ca not even see it
now you hold it still
that is Paul's name
we had to use the pliers
he is giving them names
that is a boy
I looked in there
it came from the box I think
you have_to have wood
it is a poodle
that is not a letter that is a sign for dividing
only it did not have a mask over his eyes
d a l e
here are some signs for the office
it works like a puppet Adam
that is your name
that is not a hammer
those are nice Adam
you do it like that round the edges
for your office
you put your hand in it
look Adam these puppets are waiting for something to eat
I am sure you did
this is shaving cream
that is not a tiger
I thought you wanted her to read you a story
you only did one side
they are waiting for something for lunch
he kicked his sock off
there's one over there
see you hold it down like this
let us play it
I think that might be something of Daddy's
I do not think that is a car
like a police whistle
you are going to divide things with him
he just does not like socks
that is Ursula's glove
I do not see a mirror there
an animal doctor
for making small things
I think you do
you do not think that is a truck
I do not usually keep soup in my refrigerator
that does not look like a banana
this is another word Adam
Adam do not throw sticks
that tastes so good
do not break it dear
I keep it in the cabinet
at the pet shop
that is h e he
this really goes under here
and then it has three lines
here's another word
you have_to wrap it around first
we have enough fish for supper
you put it on there and you look through the hole
I think it might be something that flies in the air
you always begin with number one
I am very sleepy
I just want to sit by the fire
here's another word Adam look
they are all out in the field
that is all you need a pair of scissors
and gave it to Bobo to eat
to my children
I do not think it is an airplane
Paul you come over and play with this
I wonder too
go over and under
look an e looks like that
that is the way they are made
that is for big boys Adam said
I will let you use this
you do not know
let us take the ones out first
there's a truck stuck
there's a yellow one and a blue one
I have it
something in cages
these are the germs from dirty hands down here
it is two pieces
do not do that
I am going touch you xxx
Paul you are just so helpful
it does not have any wings
there's a red one too
Adam do not throw the stick now
that hurts Paul
I think it had be better if you took your hat off
it is called a level
that is just the way it was made
I see it
Paul tries to put the key in the keyhole
for being sure that things are straight
over on this side
there that looks nice
I see two
Paul stop that
I do not have_to take any cooking equipment
I think that is the number six
we ca not hear ourselves think
you might hurt his head
sounded like he said yeah
you have_to do something to it first
here here's something for you
it is a drill
I do not think so
you can make holes with it
I had like some sunglasses on
that was very good
I have not seen you for a long while
careful do not break that
they took a bus to the hardware store
this sun is too bright
I think perhaps you will have_to put it together in some way
this is two
there it is
let me see
I think I might have something
I just did not think you had like to have a kitty
do not do that
a milk truck
you might not like it
that is better
you may break him
those are cherries Adam
you look funny
he does not move
that is better
gonna play with it
let us think a little while
you have_to keep your nose up in the air
Adam you know better than to throw
you will have_to take that and punch that out
that is not a saw Adam
wait till it stops
you are having a hard time
those two are just alike
those are germs from dirty faces
a lamb had a broken leg at the children's zoo
put your finger there
they wo not fall out
and here we have the germs from dirty xxx
that is a drill
you like to shave
because the door is not wide enough
I think so
do not put it in your mouth
I do not know
in a few minutes
he just had it
somebody's unhappy outside
you look like you are about to lose your pants
she might have that for Robin
the toy that rolls
Paul come away from there
that is going to be Adam
that is better
down there near your belt
you do not give your beard time to grow
do not put your fingers down there because it is very sharp
you will be a duck with a hand
that is from Pinocchio
let us see Adam
that is one
it looks like those legs might belong to a little girl
Paul come here
it says fold on dotted line
he can play with a few
p as in Paul
let us see
a toy car
you need just one more
I am not a little boy
put it down
to eat the bird
I do not remember that
a d a m
move your fingers I ca not see
Paul stay away away away from there
you have finished shaving
these are lines here
you mean a fish net
you play with something else a minute while I get Paul up
I do not know
see that is not a straight line
he is got your germs Adam
I am busy and you are busy
this is the start a
the elephant will stand up too
I think Paul had this Adam
he is got your germ list
Jack and the Beanstalk
I think you might need some help with that
that is going to pop
I do not know about the lion
makes a hole for a screw
you come back here
we just had an a
I think you have had everything in the bag now
ladies do not have_to shave
he just wants to know about germs too
I have one thank_you
that is a grand hat
it is a file
you have_to match these numbers
the creature from the beanstalk
that is a very nice hat
I do not think I need anything else from the store today
that is three and that is three
I will go upstairs later
David does not shave yet
this is h
save one for her
I will be back in a minute Paul
poor little cow
maybe he wants to be a doctor
good for you Adam
do the bird
I do not think you want to serve me
I do not feel anything there
look through the light
Hercules begins with an h
your name begins with a a
cluck cluck cluck cluck
it is something to do
let me see
Paul's name begins with a p
I guess I needed it to sew something
one one half quart
Adam put it on the other way I think
you can make the bird fly
macaroni and beans
a d a m
he can flap his wings
I think I will bring it back again
four goes here
do not use all the tape dear
you said that was one
be careful you do not hit your hand Adam
I am going to drink my coffee
he ca not be a doctor while he is a baby
channel o goes next
hi sleepy head
in_case something tears
I think so
he can just pretend
it is to make strong muscles
it says four years old
like you can pretend
like you can just pretend
that is k
that is something from last time
I will hold it
that is very nice
I think you are sitting on the razor
I think it will
take your finger off Adam
I do not think your scissors are up here
I could not carry very much
you do it
look at Paul he has gone to sleep
I do too
now that is enough
let us get something to do it on
he is been trying this for the past several days
your finger could not get in there
it is already in
that is the first part
then you have_to take it outside on a windy day
careful of my long white beard
I do not know
Adam you ca not play that while you are eating
you had an accident
I think you broke it
that is the story of Cinderella
you almost caught me
there is not much wind at all
I do not think Robin would have been walking down Washington Street
hold it up to the light
hold it up toward the light
that is a compass
we will see
I never saw a dragon on a farm before
my pants is are going to lose
I do not know
I think it is upside down
and he does not think like you do
and the other one he says is just Joe
I see you did
we could fold this this way
Paul he would not like for you to do this
you thought you had it
you mean you are going to lose your pants
he is not as big as you
just slide it under
put it on the chair
Adam you are a silly
they will get lost
that was very good
because that is something that has not developed
it is going to end up like flypaper
perhaps the other Joe would be a better driver
watch the little cars
do not do that
hold it up toward the light
we will see
you can throw it away if you want to
I do not know
you always need something to wipe you off
wait til you finish one and get it together
I guess so
because you wanted me to put it on your finger
you have_to learn
you did not break it
take your time
he was in your truck
let us see if you can
I think I have a scissors
I guess so
you look sleepy
I lost my sandwich apart
it did not seem that you needed any
here it is
we have_to keep those in_case we have a real emergency
Ursula's going to check
a may fly
put it on the chair honey
he ca not find it
you will make a refrigerator with two holes
I do not know
on the farm
this been wrapped on here
just a minute we will see
he did not mean to
that is Cinderella
she is losing her shoe or her slipper
it is a stone fly
he can ride in something else
you have_to put one back
that is the college that Cecelia goes to
you go to nursery school
I suppose so
you do not know
I am a mommy chicken and I have got seventeen baby chicks
to make it a little stronger
Agricultural and Technical College
do not hit my fingers
it is a sharp one
those are Cinderella's sisters trying the slipper on
he is not peanut+butter yet
you do it
Cinderella met by the prince at the palace
because there's too much snow
Paul is the service station man
I like to bring things back because then they are surprises
you are always turning my beater
now both lights are on
you do not use your fishing rod like that
at the apartment
I do not think so
I will hold it while you turn
you have_to push another one out
I have never seen you on my farm
I have got a flat tire
I know you do
just Mr Peanut
they are getting ready for the ball
that is a firetruck
it wo not move
I have got a flat tire
it looks like a bottle opener
you are huh
for catching fish
so you bring your jeep and fix my flat tire for me
I think he is all finished by now
red street light
push it all the way up
I do not know
you have_to stop
I thought you said something about become a spider
I had like some Seven_up
Cinderella bringing the pumpkin to the godmother
I do not know
green light you may go
now you can reach it
perhaps he is finished too
I do not know that kind
the repair man is here now
the Indians tied him up
while you eat
those are Ursula's glasses
do not you eat my chickens
I do not know
now he can find it
that is your finger
you do too have glasses
I do not go to nursery school
bring the can up to here
you have sunglasses that she gave you
you go to nursery school
let us put it over this way
the whole thing
ring ring ring
maybe it is the same dragonfly
you turn it dear
if I close one eye
blow gently now
you are a funny little boy
you are going to drink some Seven_up
perhaps you had like to look at another one
now here's one for you
not too hot
do not put it in your mouth dear
start with this m then you need an o
in your bowling ball box
there are a few stories and lots_of cities
it is not to eat
I think Daddy wo not come in again
he does not want to play
first you mark with a pencil
I thought maybe they were having something else
Mr Head Lead
we need another m
hello Doctor Adam
I do not know
I was not there
I guess they were Cub_Scouts
there's just a little bit more
that is part of his sleeve
you give me a kiss
you changed your mind
it is not a tear
here's another story
I suppose so
just a little while
so_that it wo not burn while I am cooking it
crawl under the bed
Goldilocks' mother that is Goldilocks
those are stands for the other animals
they look too tiny to bite
here's another one
that would go here and that spells mom
not without breaking
for one of those other trucks
some puppies do
those are baby fish
because you like it
hold it toward the light
maybe you can drill a hole too
the bear's house
I do not know the name of it
it is dark under there
on this part
that is a new kind of bird
those are bowling pins
it tasted like spice cake
a Mr Grant bird
I will get some slides
I never heard of that bird before
these go on paper that you put in notebooks
you and Robin are friends
now shoot over toward Paul's bed
and this keeps the holes from tearing
you are strong
let us put these up first
she is eating all the baby bear's porridge
here's your money Doctor
that is very nice
thank_you very much
we have_to put it up
you play on this side
I think you have that wrong
you just make it around and make a handle
she is breaking Baby_Bear's chair
I do not bring water in my bag
I thought I only had to pay ten dollars
you will cut your fingers
a red one
I think your Mother is going to get some
I need some milk for the little children at my school
you are a big boy
I could not carry it
she sat on the chair and the chair went pop
perhaps the shoelace got tangled that time
it would spill all over
over that way further
here I go
see if you can hit the pillow in Paul's bed
careful with your dirty fingers
it is your turn
goodness you must have used it all
look under Goldilocks
you do not know
that is an h for horse
here's some more
here are your glasses
I thought they were h
you are at the zoo
the three bears return home from their work
I guess so
I do not know
you ca not find water at the zoo
those are blue
you do not need any money
I thought it was a bus
they have blue ink on them
do not sit down dog dog barks
because then you ca not paint
I have a blue one
I just gave you some money Doctor
a cat says meow car truck
Adam Smith come back here
I ate my supper all up
it is probably your finger
Adam will show you pictures Paul
he is just looking
I do not think that would work
go get two pennies out then
it wo not turn
maybe Adam would like to paint his popsicle sticks
I will hold this while you draw a straight line
the baby bear discovers Goldilocks in his bed
I have one
do not break the pencil
turn it the other way
you ca not
here's another one
this is a fish fly
she has_to do lots_of writing and she needs every pencil she has
here they all are
because my hand is too large to go any further
Goldilocks runs away from the three bears
I never saw a fish fly
dip the brush in paint lots_of times so it is one color
because she is frightened
he raises corn and wheat
you ca not have that
your hand fits in there further than mine
tell me one
wheat for making bread
sometimes I call my children bunny rabbits
that is something in Italy
they are carrying very big flags
because he does not need it
I think you have it in the wrong way
he is just a little boy
you are very kind
you could do all those colors
here's another picture of it
he did not realize that it is only paper
that is the beginning
that is a giant water bug
watch your fingers
sometimes I call my children pumpkins
we saw this already
do not cut your thumb Adam
here you may keep three pennies
now are you gonna help me this time
come back over here because you may hit me
a little bit
roll it around until you get a good color
put the nickel back
it is a water scorpion
put it back in the drawer
that is the road over there
wait a minute
you always put in number one
do not get caught in here
I am not keeping you from flying
you are silly
trying to put this back in
there's a tray
put it back in the yellow
just turn toward the light
we will let Paul
Mr Truck you almost had an accident
an extension cord
he is going on an airplane
just like Paul
you get nice thick colors
this must be a new one
that is a little boy taking the cow to market
it is not a tape recorder
sometimes I call them puppies
you almost did
Paul's going to be the doctor
I do not believe it
only one butter
you have not cut yourself yet
my brother got those
that wo not be enough
almost made a spear
that is the part of the machine that moves that part over
the duck can share a tray with me
look here it is
he can follow the direction to wash his hands
nothing in that hand either
that is Jack exchanging the cow for a pig
you have got_to be careful now
I think I still need more milk
it is tape
poor little baby
and Jack trades the pig for a bean
I am glad
I did not know you were a cat
you are making a bird's nest or something
David used to be a cat
stop that Paul
you could use this tray and I could use my lap
I need more than that for twenty children
he understands go to bed
it is still a good one
that is part of the machine
you come finish eating your cake
there are lots_of houses
that is Jack's house
that is still not enough
that is the way a rocket blasts off
that is the way you screw
I thought so
be very careful
it is not dark
here's a horsie
your Daddy is going to get after you
here Paul here's a pretend for you
let Paul have one honey
for taking this out
he likes to see it turn
goodbye at the zoo
that is my sister
you do not want anyone to recognize you
he knows about books
he wo not hurt it
you hurt yourself
let him play with some
that would spoil the paints
you were sitting on him
you could drill a hole through that
I think that might be nice
you do not have a girl
I think these are places mostly
careful do not step on his finger
be careful Adam
do not put your fingers here
on the shelf
he can play with that one
some more noodles
you must have a_lot_of noodles by now
that is a may fly
sometimes I watch them build houses and make furniture
the giant through the window
sometimes I call my children squirrels
that is a finger
a mashed one too
in the bread box
you were cooking Paul said
that is the giant
a sea green monster
use your hammer and take it out
this is just a small one
Jack is peeking through the window and he sees the giant
I do not think she saw that one
I am a monster now
a pencil I think
we used to call them a squeezle
it is not a tricycle stick
do not write on yourself
he is a talking house
it is a popsicle stick
that is a water bug
it is in_between a squirrel an a weasel
write on the paper
you can screw that on
you made so many noodles
he is in the chair
near the table
it has the cap on it to cover it
I guess he is just a little boy
it is almost like a stone fly
probably it would have sharp teeth
she went to a beauty salon
I have got one thank_you
and then you eat frozen whatever it is
I meant for you to write on the small pad
that is a door
let me see
the table is above that
oops you lost something
I think he said chowder
look at Ursula
and then they throw the popsicle stick away
there's one over there
let us see that is part of the motor
that is a giant water bug
he looks like one of George Washington's troops
you have_to work a little harder
do not write on you either
Jack takes the treasure from the sleeping giant
you could feed twenty children with all those noodles
the thread out
one of the members of George Washington's army
the giant crashes down
you stop on a red light
I ca not drink so much
I think we just need one more under here
just takes a little practice
you could turn it over and cut a door in it
the light's green
that is an h for Hercules
let us go now
it is your hat Paul
she is holding you
m a r x
they can break their bones
you do have a_lot_of children
you must have a hard time feeding all those children
you were not a little baby
let Paul wear it
I do not believe I have ever seen that
let Paul see
you can keep those
you dropped all the slides
wait Mr Driver
you do it
I do not want to
the giant crashed down
Adam has a doggie
let us find someplace to put the shells
and then I will bring it back sometimes
watch your fingers Adam
pull it back and forth
I do not know that he talks
I hope he can swim
Paul you come back over here
you are just getting in your brother's way
the car would not work
spend my money buying some more records
look get off my chair
he did not fall out_of the boot
let Ursula see
you missed it
the bell behind you
the boat just tipped over
use the diaper
Adam's going to give you the block Paul
I ca not use that while you are there
put in number one
I do not know
you march with it
a dinner bell
he gave me a block
I think it is brown too
that has_to be a new hole
that is it
so_that the razor will cut the beard
I still have some water
I think you can
you may leave them there
that was Paul
you do not have a garage
there's a blue
here's your can
it does not fit properly
Adam let him have something
you lost your blade
there's a picture on the wall of Boy_Scouts at the Liberty_Bell
we used to call you tiger a long time ago
you ca not
now wipe the blade
Paul would like to see it too
the same bell
you are sitting on some
I do not remember
the Doctor found some birdies
wipe the blade
do not rub it in too much
here's another one
that was our back yard
then you ca not see any
that is a level
to see if something is straight
do not use so much water
I do not think it is time to play this
I am sorry
hello said the bird
hello said the bunny
you can make a door that opens
I have some here Adam
here's the folder
pour some in another cup
those are some pictures
maybe you better go find out
you need some paper first
the other part is not here
now put a patch on it
that was Provincetown
she does not have the other part
awoh your house fell over
I was not drinking your juice
that is it
I think that is very nice of them
there's a door
the pad that you press that into
he was giving it to you Adam
she said two
he probably rides in the car
I just moved your glass so you would not knock it over
you put them on
because there was a hole there
it is in
I do not have them on
put the others back
I just think you need to buy some new tires
here's a fire truck
I do not see anybody looking out
knock it over
it must be in your room in the drawer
I am waiting for you to shave it off my hand
now these we have_to be very careful with
that is a magazine
you have given up on Mommy blowing
I am afraid I ca not blow them up
now you wo not have so many flat tires
you have_to be very careful with them and write only on paper
I am a circus man
so he is tired
I train the elephants
he was giving you something Adam that he found
he really understands a deal
I did not
on the top shelf
I did not tell you to use all that
wait Adam do not pull the bag in the water
on the other side
maybe Paul took it
you are finished playing with it
shame on you Paul
he just thinks it is fun to get the toys
I never heard of a Flupper_nutter
we do not have any different colors
it ran under the railroad track
you really caught it
let us put those in first
you look like a deep sea diver
perhaps he uses his oar to push out from the shore
you are the doctor
I am afraid you will forget and throw that
here are two little cars
we have_to put this one up higher
I tried very hard
here it is
I am not going to tell you
only put one in at a time
you do not throw sticks
you do not have any more flat tires
you tell me
that does look like an a
let us put those in first
this is for big boys
I do not think that is very nice
that is the kind of mask you wear under water
there's a cow
do not cry Paul
in this box
I do not think there's anything in there
I think so
we better put a cup under there
that is pretty Adam
toward the light
pay me seven
he lost his sail
you said seven
that is a pretty color
I thought you had seen one of those before
I do not believe that is the truth
you only gave me four
he just has a few of them
let us throw some things away
let us see if I can get it out this time
just as long as I am holding him
careful do not pull it so hard
not by himself
you gave me four dollars
that is very pretty
a Dick Tracy car
you should have given me seven
give me seven now
they are singing
I will give you the four back
they are singing
count them out
Paul look here
I do not know you will have_to ask her
I do not know if there's a whole set or not
the man who's standing up has a guitar
stay on the paper Adam
it is to draw
I will go get some
perhaps the wind blows the boat over
all these toys
I had like a boat pie
you need paper
there's something else here to look at
she wo not have any to give to Robin and David
I looked for it at home too
we walked and Paul was in the stroller
I am sorry
I thought it was ready
it must be lost someplace
he ca not walk
just write with it
he is too heavy for Mommy to carry
then you ca not use your car anymore
that is just the shadow of you and the slide
it is a bunny rabbit
this is orange
that is a ranch
except we do not call that a banjo
that is red
that will be enough
I am not going to tell you
that is for shaving
to erase on the typewriter
you blow it
it is not for eating
now I feel all better
be careful that you do not cut your fingers with that
he has a book
he just wants to keep them for you
one red and two orange
if you turn it that way it looks like something to me
this is hard to do
the cream that you put on there
I do not think that is a banjo
you can only use one thing at a time
I am not going to tell you because you saw it too
here's a gas station
did you have a ride on your boat today
this is the stand for the gas station
watch your fingers
let us get back up on the paper
I do not think I had want anything now
you do not need another
you used it all
I was speaking to Adam
you blow it out
put it in the play+pen so Paul wo not get it
then maybe that is enough
Paul you are just not cooperative
I do not know
here's one Adam that you had like to see
I am not a man
you will have lots_of gas
it is a water show
that one is about Italy
you do not mean razor blades
that is a new one
Paul does not like for me to put it on
because you did not have it down in there properly I guess
Paul saw some nice things
let Paul see
begins with a
I will start it for you
I do not know
you do not seem to remember
you can do it on the floor too Adam
he is going to think that that is Mommy
let us look at that one
you excused me from the table
you were standing and he took the picture
I do not know
I do not know
I do not think he wants it on Adam
if you do it faster you can see it change colors
that had be a nice one to show Ursula
that is an electric shaver
I got it started Adam
this is the one about Italy
it was an animal
that is for decoration
we went to the Boston Common
that is you on your birthday
go back Rinny
that is black
let Paul play with this while you play with something else
one at a time
Adam you look like you are breaking out with something
you need it to fly the plane
it is already black
show it to Ursula
on your forehead
it is like a foot rest
now fold the other one back
across your nose
you can make all sorts of things with these
see he stands up by himself
you just saw this one
it must have come from another one
he does not seem to be very concerned
this is the one about Arizona
you can bend it in any direction
you ca not do them all at once Adam
let Ursula look at you
Paul woke up last night and was just playing in his bed
he tries to ate this
then you could not see anything
I guess not
I do not know
you can take this whole page off
this is about Israel
put it on a
go let Ursula look at it
we have a Cub_Scout named Israel
this goes on the bus
just push this down
this the country
you ca not wash paint until it dries
you went out at nursery school
that was an accident
the paint's all on your hands
I should hope not
I was playing
you take another color
awoh not yet
I will change
I was xxx
here's one for you
you take this
I was xxx
do not take it apart Diandra
so you are all finished
you could crayon in that book
this is about Utah
you are building a house
now do not do that again
this is Paul's
we need a scissors
you wo not see anything
I was talking to Paul just then
that had be very funny
I think the scissors are upstairs
I will help you finish the bus
you almost did
these are nice Adam
I see something up here
if you say the magic word
you might break it Adam
so_that we wo not hear the noise from out there
you had a string in your hair
let us look at this one
here are some of the other kind if you want
I need the directions Adam
you did not say the magic word yet
you only put one in at a time
I was giving it to you
you paint with a paint brush
this is about Holland Michigan
there are some flowers here that you have seen before
I thought perhaps if you looked you could tell me
it is part of it
Diandra come over here
I see something
that is not finger paint
this is a flower
that is water color
use your brush honey
we will finish the bus
I do not know
I did not go anyplace
arts festival last year
the ones in front are the same color
you could make a pair of glasses
there's not enough instructions for me
that is another bronze
you can always take them apart and make something different
here's a book we could read
you are silly
I think so
it says do it like this
that rhymes with it
he said winner
and then you let it go like that
and the monkey
a toy house
I wo not bite
she had like to see that one
here's something I think you will like Adam
let us not throw things
that is the way
they are building a fair
he is feeling better
I think you will like that
here's the parade
maybe he is hungry
she is giving you one
I do not think so
in a parade
they do not feel like snow
let us see if we see the king
part that goes across there
you got it in
do not pull
a bike has a back like that
I am not
you will break it
I am sure I ca not either
it is not snow
there are lots_of other pieces around
it will dry out
maybe he is already there
I do not want to look at Bozo
that is nice
do not do that
go over there so you wo not jump on us
just paint your truck now
I had like to watch the Friendly Giant
you just paint that
it looks like it is made out_of paper
I guess that will still fly
it is a little misshapen circle
the kangaroo house
he is calling you
put your pajamas the floor
you were telling me about a movie that you saw
a little bit too big
let us take one
I thought you said it was about somebody fighting something
back up pilot
you can make a watch
that is a very good idea
some kind of fighter
that was not black
that was brown
let me see who's taller
Adam did you play hey_diddle_diddle
now you do the rest
come on Diandra
let us look in the basket
I want xxx
you are in my chair
I have some money
we will take you out another day
you have_to drive slowly
you painted it
you are supposed to move
he is got a whole bunch of packages in his pocket
now you have_to put it down and let it dry
tall tall tower
or else the bull will knock you down
because you took the plug out I see
maybe one end could go on the drawer
I will show it to you
I do not think I need money thank_you
it will fit
leave it in here Adam
let us put this back first
say thank_you Adam
she left it for me
and a bottle and some feathers
Paul was trying to put that one in his shoe
you leave it on there
you can tie it go ahead
it is a statue of a lion
we are going to a birthday party
it is not a clock really it is a compass
if you ca not tie it maybe Robin can tie it
it is tucked inside there
it means that you like it and like to share it
it is a driver's license you want to see
it tells you directions
it has on numbers that tell you north east south and west
that is a camera
Adam told you not to tear it up
going to make a tent and go to that birthday party
do not stand so close
and here's Alexander
I shared my book with you
pick the animals up and throw them in
let us see
now maybe you could put a screw in that hole
I do not know
they are going deep sea diving
Ursula brought it for Adam to play with
here's the other one
you do not have a knight book
that is a stamp
especially airplanes because they do not have any roads to go on
there it is
until you wash it off
you are a silly
they all put on diving suits
let me see if there's something you can hang in the box
there's one over these
this one's going up to the top
look at it
your line is slipping down
I was looking
they go and have little something
put them up there
you have_to come back
it is a screw driver
one dollars two dollars three four five
Robin show him
he can hold one
wait boys let us not fight
we have_to go one after another
he wo not lose it
put it in from the back
I will throw that at you
you did not give me enough
there's another one
this is mine
I said five
here's some paper
maybe you could both work on this one
they are watching a puppet show
here's a good pen
these are puppets
because I do not know that much about fishing
it is good exercise for you
these kangaroos are in there
this is a fix if you want yours in a particular place
here's another one
you only gave me one dollar
that is a dragon
do not tear the paper
his name is Leonard Lion
you do not have any
the cat and the fiddle
I do not know
that was the last cranberry juice
you left your pocketbook
let him play with that
I am not playing Indian
Ursula tore it
you touch mine
there's one in your hand
you can really wear this
in the forest
I am a nice guy
I am a silly lady
I did not buy any cranberries I bought some strawberries
put it through the back
then they could not see
this is hard to do
now it is night time
maybe you could cut some things from it
because it is stuck through the paper
he is in the first grade
you paid me enough money
Ursula is Ursula
here Adam here's yours
I guess something is disturbing him
they have_to go back
first they go for a boat ride
you are welcome
this is a pill box
it is a country
here are the boats
you did not ask her about those
I think she has an interesting story to tell about those
let us take one piece to start with
it will dry very quickly if you just leave it there
that is the nose
careful do not hurt Paul
that is enough
I do not know
I got it in the store like that
it is long and thin
the country called Italy is shaped like that
Adam wants to use it now
wait I do not feel like boxing
you must have a big tummy ache
there's one other thing
under your sweater
he needs both of the he says
it is many miles
that is Adam's pocketbook
you read that one to me if you like
I do not want to eat my animals
it does not help to cry
it does not come off really
the wheels might be up in here
we just pretend to get it off
you missed these
it is just shaped like one
close the door Adam
they do not drop down until you are read to land
you can use the Scotch tape if you want Adam
that noise was a big truck outside
you are going to serve us out here
let us do it on top of the newspaper
Paul he says for you not to mess up my things
that is the windshield wiper
we have_to have scissors to cut it out
you make a hole for Paul
remember to put de cover on
let him have the car honey
any way you wish dear
I think it is a rhinoceros
because it get dry
that is very pretty
the other hand
count the boys
ouch you hit my toe with that big power shovel
you could give me a shot
I did not do that
it is not a ball to throw
I do not think I had like either one thank_you
here's some medicine
because I was afraid you were hurt
I do not give money out in the store
put the cover back on Adam
let us use this one
I just sell food
we need a circle just that size
a circle just that size
you put them in separate groups on the floor
he wants to play with you
just like that
it has a tip
I will trim it just a bit
he is going to drill a hole for you
that is very nice
I thought you went to nursery school
I will sell it to you for fifty cents
you look in there and I will look in here
I did not think dogs and bulls were such good friends
the tagalong man
put the cover back on
you do not have_to have a dollar
maybe you had like to build with Robin
that is the biggest round one
now Adam let us start I cut this way
I think something's wrong with that
it does not seem to be making a hole
he does not know dogs and boys
I thought you were looking for a scissors
it shoots medicine
it is in the bank
you turn this
you are gonna pull a trick on me
I will hold this down
thank_you very kindly Adam that was very nice of you
let us sort them out
in the bank
you turn it
here's the ball
I do not know exactly
hold my hand we are going to cross the street
here's another one
I had some spaghetti like a corkscrew
you can turn it over and do a different one
it sounds like you are scratching your floor
that is a very pretty umbrella
and you have_to put it around her head
it is hard
lots_of different things
you have_to ask for it
I will see if I can make the shape
remember Paul's a dinosaur
not too fast
you can keep the board
that is got a_lot_of writing on it though
I put mine away over here
just blow very hard
I had some like this
you can have this one
you are the big brother dinosaur
I did not
I did not know an umbrella had arms
I think you could blow it Adam
I think perhaps it might do better on the floor
Diandra here's your book dear
your letter the one you wrote
I did not know that an umbrella had arms
see Robin can read
I thought you drew one for me
Paul has his
each time you move it it gets a different design
here they are
I think he means old+fashioned
just like you blew up the duck
do not forget the cover Adam over under the chair
I want xxx
she brought all the toys the other day
here's the wing
that is hard
there it is
Paul that was a very nice story
is not that nice
here's a star
it will take time it has_to grow
you said to put up my umbrella
you are stuck
here Adam here's the cap
I just do not know about Rocky
you could fold it
it might do something surprising
Robin would you give him a few pieces of paper
it looks like an old+fashioned light bulb
smoking a peace pipe
that is my umbrella
that is nice
Adam says he is your father
you are going to give me a shot
Paul is still sleeping
he is making you an umbrella
try to get the air down through the hole
you read a story to the class now
in_case you want to carry it with you
you blow and let me go get Paul and Diandra
look in the mirror Adam
that is my umbrella
it is too tight
Adam says it is mine
it is mine
I am going upstairs and check on Paul
it is a little bit too big
it is mine
that was very close
now it looks like a street light
it is mine
make it a tiny bit smaller
I had it first
you did not put the top back on the yellow
you almost did
Robin told you
you can pour things through here into a small bottle
a bean bean
you just put it on there
maybe you could hang it on the line
you boys stop chasing each_other
it looks like he is heading for the chair leg
let us make it a tiny bit smaller
bigger than this room
that is not good for you
you hold this down
take a test
I know you wo not
these are tea cakes
and you saw some toys of his
there's some over there on the floor
I am going to take a little air out_of mine
you saw his tricycle
I will give him mine
do not make him cry
it looks like a big flower
Adam's going to make you an umbrella
I do not think you had like for Rinny to bite you
there's more tape
that is not a real tea cake
try it again
because you gave me a hint
use your finger
I think you could
here see if this fits your other finger
there were three
it is easier the second time
not too fast
keep your mouth tight around the pipe
wait here Adam I will get some for you dear
you need to go slower with it
I am not used to sitting on the floor
that is a good idea
this long stem
Adam almost has your umbrella ready Diandra
if you say so
and we have three children and two bikes
maybe one day
the driver sometimes is called the pilot
one of the Beatles
you have a brother
it is plastic
that is his piece of paper and his pen
it is so hard
I ca not see them
David is eleven now
I think they get it inside of certain trees in South America
I think so
I do not know
do not forget the top
let us try it
she lives so far away
it is a surprise
here's my pen
this is my pen
to make tires and balloons and rubber bands
fly on an airplane
not too fast Adam because it does not work
I see the scissors
we see Underdog
you could play it with Robin
it is behind the crayons
it has_to drip through the funnel
my car is broken
I think so
I think that is enough for that bottle
I think so
whatever you had like to play
I think that is the bottom of the pill box
here's the red
my car does not work anymore
I will blast it off for you
I certainly do
because it is a pen that is writing
you just made that up
it wo not start at all
the thing inside the tire is a compass
I think so
is that the baby fish
Diandra has the tape
that is a horse
those are made out_of metal
that would be pretty
the lowest sound
all the other ones should be higher than that
if you know someone in Italy
come on Paul
hold the funnel up
I could make one for every finger if you want
xxx are made out_of wood
put it on
I have never seen him
he certainly is a sleepy little boy
metal comes from under the ground
under the ground
here we are at camp
if you have a quarter you can change it into two dimes
just a minute
you have_to pin it on
tomorrow would be fine
I guess I made it too small
I might not be able to get here that early
you find shells in the bottom of the sea
there are some holes
that is very nice Adam
for the sound
I had it first
that is a beautiful bow
they draw on it
maybe the hole is for the sound to come out
look at those colors
close the door
here's your bow
paint on it
that is five cents
I am going to put this away
I thought you said you could read it
I do not know
those are not cigarettes
you are cutting out to send to Italy
and I used to come and visit you
you could wear a suit to cover you all up
I do not know
I brought you that from Switzerland
Adam move move Adam
they are just driving along
move from xxx
I think she heard someone coming in the door
to go under the water
you can open it this way
maybe we could do it on the table
that is spray
you told me about one last time
turn it around
I saw a movie about it
I do not think she thought it was a tiger
take out one piece at a time
pick the chair up
they did not have enough air
that is a very funny thing
so you can get a turtle in the middle
you could hang it from the ceiling
if I am Peter you are Joe
that is all
pick it up Paul Smith
pick it up
that is gonna be nice
now you can change it
that is Robin
they went down and explored the bottom
it is full
there it is
put your fingers there
I certainly do not
we have just been to camp
that is a bicycle
I could show you some pictures of that movie
we had a nice time
it has_to be in this room though
you made my umbrella
hope you have a nice time
she probably was going to use it for something
that is a very long one
a big truck
try it like that
he had one of those
that makes it wavy
and then I gave them back to you
sounds like a motor+scooter to me
Goldilocks xxx in the big papers
it makes it wavy like on the ocean
I do not think so
I like this one
I would care
I will give them back now Adam
you can straighten it out
Robin give Diandra his balloon
you can roll it again
is not that nice
I have not seen her since she was a puppy
I would not mind if a monkey wakes me up
that is a nice place
I could draw around it
that is nice of you
and you could cut on the line
you do not want to lose the tops
they are all covered in suits
that is good
you do not want to ride on the train
that is not a box
it is pretty good
that is your dot maker
it is supposed to be a case
I did not know you had scissors fingers
that is pretty
you can make a man with his arms and legs and everything
there's one more piece here
I will take them off
I have_to park my car first
I think you missed the bottle
let us see
try them all
push it down
we can make some flowers
here's another piece
I do not know
I do not think so
I bet you are sitting on it
that is not slow
then maybe each person would have_to take care of himself
you are making him all wet
s d o s
I just made this one up
do not go in the bath+room dear if somebody's in it
that is Robin's favorite color too
I think so
I am sorry
here's a color
I did not mean to take that
that looks pretty Adam
thank_you for the chocolate hair
you said it was chocolate spray
I am not ready
do not take his things Adam
that is a building block to the house
here you are Adam
here Adam has that bottle
I think something will happen
draw a dog on the merry+go+round
that can go wherever you want
I think something will happen
it would be a lot easier if you were both named Joe
something like gloves
you are going too fast
that is enough thank_you
go get the other piece
this is the first time he is tried this naming
Paul and Diandra stop it
you can keep those
let us make it all flat first
that is enough both of you
we are at the farm now
Adam will give it to you
now fold it up
they are cotton balls
it is a funny flower
they are already here
I do not think it will close if you put too many
for cleaning things
do it on the newspaper
I put that in there to rinse the bowl
I will have_to make a square first
they are up there by my purse
here's another one
I do not think you need any more honey
press it straight down on the stamp pad
good for you for putting all the tops on Adam
some greenery some grass some shrubs
it says six five four two zero seven
I could make a bird
my you are hungry
it says the same
I might just save mine
she is upstairs talking to somebody
you can change the numbers
must be a gun
you must have lost it
I am not hungry just now
six five four one nine seven
I think we wo not open that yet
just one more
that was a sneeze
maybe next time
then we have_to make a sprinkling can
six five four three eight
stop stop I want to get off
you are tearing up too much
now do the way I sneeze
six five four three eight
keep your fingers off
that would not be nice to do
I have_to finish folding it first
it is supposed to be a bird not a tent
you are making a mess there
that is another pill box
seven five four two zero seven
it is still under your knee
you fold it to be a wing
it is a little tiny pill
from all of those on the bottom
is that a test
you are just tearing up too much paper
that is not a test
it will come off
you can wash it off
you can take that out to play with
you can surprise your Mother
we will do it next time
look at that
it is like a rainbow
there's your bird
you can keep it
all lined up and ready to go
wait a minute
open it up and take half
I have_to put this on you
that was for you
it is a pill box
let us try
open it up and see
those are birds
I do not think so
you really think so
here's your watch
you want to look at the little book
now it ca not pinch you
I will just enjoy yours
perhaps there's some more of it some place
that is all I have got
I did not even feel it
I bet you know
see they are cave men
I am going to keep mine on
that is nice colors that you have there
and they have got animal skins on for clothes
I am glad you do
that is good
I do not think you have the barn quite finished yet
that is it
maybe it needs to be a little longer for you
he is a man
it comes off
you look very elegant
sometimes they kill animals for their skins for clothing
I know you are
you fold on the dotted lines
and it lights up
and maybe they chop down trees
get off I am at the farm
let us put them away
you did not quite finish taking it out
the things you need that the doctor uses
I am going to keep my ring on too
it is called a pterodactyl
let me see if it needs cleaning
I do not think you put the medicine in there
it is like a big flying dinosaur
I will drive one of those cars
that they have at the carnival that you get in and drive
that is a long one Adam
you have_to start here
I do not think so
two six two
long fishing rod
I think so
let me try
one three seven eight
I like to ride on the boat
I do not know
that is for taking medicine
this is a key
it gets into lots_of trouble
he is taking a rash off my hand
I do too
I guess this is going to fit here
we are going to need some crackers and a bowl
I got seeds in mine
a small bowl
the kitty's home sleeping
she is waiting for everyone to come home Adam
I think maybe some little boy I know put it in
I give up
let us put the crackers on here and the bowl goes here
is not that pretty
she goes to sleep all day while we are not there
I thought we could make something for your doggie to eat
is not it nice
we just have part of it
I do not like myself very much
perhaps Robin started putting it together and did not finish
it is a grinder
you have a part missing
so we can hear better
it grinds them up
could be Robin
there's a part that goes in_between the top and the bottom
you can watch it come out here
he just opens up a package of Jello
I thought there were two back there
you could put them back through again
it is a toy clock
Mr come on Adam
a frank and a banana
I am trying to fix it
write a story for us
here's one banana
now you will have enough
I think we need a little bit of Scotch tape
here are two franks
it comes out like a waterfall
I do not think so
I think maybe that is the last time
Adam do not sit on that
it is an owl
it is not
he has big wings
you have_to give him some nice strong legs to stand on
that is true
she will be surprised
watch your fingers
the car that I have now
let us see you fly
I think that is marvelous
I have never seen your name written like that
it means I think it is very very very nice
I can fly
you have_to get out over there
I only see your name one time
all the other times your name is all wrong
sure and sheep too
Adam put your paper on the newspaper
just make a little ball
I am getting all wet
I will make a handle for the basket
just use one piece at a time
and you did not tear it off properly
see you another day
you stretch it
I think maybe that is enough
you look like you are excited
they call it a film viewer or film editor
I think it is a club a stick
you can hardly wait
then you will be here all by yourself
they taste salty and delicious
I know you are
because there's nobody behind
brush yourself off
Adam for that we need a tray
that not David
that means you can grind this up again
that is the handle to turn the film
that is a good idea
we will just pick it up with the paper
Adam Smith those are ducks
I am not sure it is wide enough
there we are
I did not have enough boxes
this one is a Popeye film
I do not know
it is a dollar sing
she is coming back
ten cents five cents and one cent
maybe we can close the curtains
if the room is dark we can see it better
you could just stand it up
you could make some bread with that
there's a bunch of grapes
you make bread out_of grain
they will last a long time
I think that was Abbott and Costello
let me have the cover back
keep coloring on the back
we will have_to take the film off to have an empty reel
let me have the cover
if you only give him two every day
that is very nice
I think we will just do it to this one
turn this upside down dip it in and then blow
here comes the other one
that very nice
maybe he had like an apple too
that is a dinosaur
do it very flat so it touches all the way around
xxx did not have a name
you forgot something
goodness they are all kinds
her name is Sally
it will taste like roast beef
once we get it on she can see it
because that is the name my mommy gave me
let us bring everything over here
let us make a little funnel
a carrot of course
blow through it
maybe it is a flying dinosaur
there's a button on the side that turns the light on
I do not think so
you are finished with it
you would not let him play with the puzzle
www and I will take Paul and Diandra
this is a little bit tricky
we talked about it and you said that Mommy could go
you made a good one
now we are getting there
I will be back shortly
turn this light on on the side
you roll it and roll it
try it again
I do not think I had like to hide under the bulldozer
it might move and I might get hurt
push it forward
I will hide behind something
let us give Paul another try
I do not have any juice today I am sorry
I think so
there we go
now do not forget to put the bowl back
you had milk today at school
there's the Popeye movie
it is going to be a huge carrot
I see you
there's a lady with lots_of children
that is the part
it is going to be a huge big carrot
now if you open it you have_to play with it
over there too
there is not any
stand up and we will clean it all off again
it will get very thin
I am all finished
Adamy do not do that
careful there's a lady on the sidewalk
they are not swords
here's your carrot
they both are bowing before her and they bumped their heads
wait for me
do not go without me
you mean there's another Adam
that is as long as it can go
they are both pulling her
she is going to break in half
that is a barn
I think so
looks like it
it is all_gone
let us see you build it
it is a snake
you can only have two
you may give Paul and Diandra another one
mine tastes like Pepsi_Cola
are not you nice thank_you
that is a c a t
he is playing all the parts
look she is stuck on a tree
poor Olive she is tied in a knot
put the box back in the bag
under the chair
those are building blocks
wait Adam do not break it now
it is on plus
that means it is going to add
he wants to build
I see them
it is not
I would not think so
they look like beds
I am not
only it gets less every time
there's just building there
this is a halloween parade
I thought a banjo was all you wanted
let us put these away first and you can have these
get over on the floor
we can use the flower
there's somebody in a white shirt
you want toothpicks
that is another Paul
Adam's not interested in this
look behind you Diandra
I do not know if I have anything else
I think I better take you out
careful do not drop it
there's something started
there's something recognizable
you better put those back
the pajamas are not to play with
let him have some of the little ones Adam
you can have some too
you use these
put some little ones in_between and then it stays better
you want to see it
this is going to be Popeye
you just took them out
careful it does not fall down
let me see it
that is all Adam
pick that up
now you do the other side
I had probably forget their names
there it is under the chair
I do not think I am very hungry thank_you
see if there's a pad of paper in my bag
he can take some
I did not bring one
I think you do need a string
maybe there is not one
it does not have any batteries
you can use this
I did not see any bag
I do not know
I guess I am hiding it
we forgot to show your Mother the rings
that is a rooftop
I have one more comedy if you want one
let us give him a few more
look at it
you can make it
let us see if we ca not make it stand up
here's a book
I doubt that
after the glamour of yesterday nothing is quite good enough
there's a punch in the bag
maybe you could draw something Adam
we can do that one we unwound
I will go get it for you
it would grind the stick up
you will break it
I am not sure Adam
I think I put them up on the mantle there
I will try
first grade just like Robin is in
I see a tree
good and then you can put a roof on
that is a good idea
you make a chain
a chain of flowers
I am not quite sure
you did not have enough of a nap
that looks high enough Adam
out out out
we have_to leave it down in the box
here's your telescope
I think this needs to be one higher
you may wind some more
you could do it if you fold the paper
I am making them
we have_to straighten the film
I have quite a ways to go
I am sorry
in your barn
goodness you are a brave little boy
I see a balloon
that is a picture of a barn
give it to Adam
a balloon with a string
that you are not afraid
I am sorry
maybe you could make a floor
that I did not bring you down anything to eat
that is not a banjo that is a guitar
I just came out here for a little while
look at your building and see
they are animals I guess
I did not see any men
play checks let me see
stop stop stop
now I do not have_to get any birthday presents
that is a real ticket
that is a real one
let me see the date
February twenty fourth
that is a good idea
that was yesterday
it would not be so hard to make steps
you need a better point
let us see if we can sharpen it
you told your skin to stop
he is going to blow in the other room
you could have an open house and walk in
you may break it dear
wait a minute
I do not think so
wait til your mother comes in
it is eleven fifteen
I guess he wants to go on there too
maybe it was a police car
maybe this house is way out in the country
he said you may color it
I just wondered
because I like to sit there
I am sorry
I am too big
you are welcome
Adam you knocked your crayons across the floor
I have never seen a striped watch
Diandra give me that
I have never seen one
that is dangerous
show it to Mommy
I thought you said you had one
he can hurt himself with it
that is a very nice boy Adam
you take one and your mother takes one
that is pretty
it is already down
that is a very nice neat boy Adam Smith
you did not draw a stem
I thought we are pretending I am small
you stay there
you have_to press the button to talk
just a minute
you made it big
it is much bigger
you had something to eat
here's a piece of paper
use the side of this for a stem
it is a bunk bed
I heard you
talking to Adam
I have two tricky boys of my own
I like you a tricky boy
you did not make a gate
I was in the forest
you need two straight pieces
these are nice
just a minute
be quiet now
and a_lot_of little pieces
draw on your paper
I think they have_to be the double kind
you could make a face a mask
the fat kind
that is nice
good very good
then it would be a mask
that is a good idea
I will go out
we will do that next
xxx out_of cardboard
Rinny's outside playing
that is going to be a big job
you start talking
let us take the biggest thing first
that is not a peacock
now you will be safe
that is a blue+jay
now I will go all the way downstairs
you go back in there
Diandra you just color for a few minutes
that was very nice of you Adam
I ca not tell
I would not be so sure
you are so busy
I did not think you had get back around to me
let me open it
I am sitting on the top stair
press the button down
I ca not tell
you said xxx
press the button down
we will fix that Adam that is not too hard to fix
try it on paper
look under your paper
that poor dinosaur
it is the stamp pad
not too hard
we may have_to put another drop of ink on there
maybe a drop of water would do
so you ca not tell
just one drop Adam
a mouse ca not eat me
I will eat the mouse
I think you are a funny boy
you are a funny boy
it is not
that is a nice color
you had have_to use the telephone
it wo not work if you put too much on there
did you see any pictures of the circus
you had probably need a bigger set
one more drop
that is just the case it came in
that is a punch
maybe we have_to use paint
help him turn it around Adam
do not put your mouth on it
he had have_to have one too
or something so he could hear you
now we need one more side
that must be paper to print on
you can see the outline of it
that would be nice
I do not think so
you can go from one end of the street to the other
that is the name
go from one end of the street to the other
you may break it
there's one more over there
you just punch two holes on the sides
one there and one on the other side
you knocked one down driver
it does not need a floor
David's eleven years old
maybe it does not
you may break it
get away from the tape recorder dear before you knock it over
I see a box over there
last time we went to get them they were out_of them
it wo not hurt you that much
it is not that bad
you can pretend
a game like Ursula brought for you
Diandra he asked you not to touch them
Adam these are really very nice flowers
your name is draw
Diandra do not say stupid
that is not nice to say
make another one and we will have a race
I did not hear you say thank_you
it is just jumping out
it is so peculiar
the boat knocked down a house
a monster magnet
let us put everything back first
you push this
there are always some more
I did not bring the top
I have my car just outside
I do not think it is supposed to stick on the wall
it is the cover that came off the puzzle
good for you
it takes very long from Harvard
I do not think it really needs water
it probably needs a little more ink in the pan
I live near there
pull this and then this
pull that back
now do this
I am in the same place
that is not really ink
that is the water that is mixed in with ink
everyone else was running outside the circle
then maybe Diandra can play with it next
come on boys let us go upstairs
I do not want a cat
I have got a dog
I do not want to have a dog
my dog is outside
let us see
that is got a score on it
these are Mexican jumping beans
be very careful
this is ten
maybe I will build a Prudential Tower
and this is twenty five
this is fifty
and this is seventy five
he can help too
it is supposed to
like a snowman
now pull that back
maybe it is a jet
and now pull this one
squeeze this all the way back
is not that nice Adam
very good Adam
that is it
look in the bag
the lights are off
is not that the way it works
I did not know he could reach it
make it go high
let us see if there's something else to do on it
good for you Diandra
this makes it fly straight I think
it made a loop
my arm is too big
let me put it on you
you have not finished playing with these
all controls xxx
now Adam you better find yourself a a target
I do not think there is one
you could use this for a target
here are the sliding_stairs
it is a dart
aim for the target
I do not think so
wo not get it
seems you have not finished playing with that
I wo not tell you
it is a secret
you missed the target
it was not in the basket
you almost got it
you could draw on it
you only had two
here it is on the chair
just one more
I would not do that
that could be dangerous
that looks like the wheel of something
I do not think it does
hit on the black
two more darts
let us look at your gun
put it back there
it says garage
if it rings again
it looks nice
she wants so much toys
I ca not see it
the little one is cafe and the big one is garage
a Mexican day
maybe I can help you fasten it
ssh take your time
I do not think so
do not throw it dear you may crack it
it is easier for Mommy to keep up with with the door
let us have the door for the special place for the darts
honey you should not really throw these things
these are for building
you can throw a ball
a rodger gun
I do not feel like reaching way up there
thirty two Williams Street and Greenwich Park
I still ca not reach it
I am afraid that wo not be sufficient
thirty two Williams Street and Greenwich Park
it is not up there by glue
these are made of plastic and they might crack
then they would not be nice to play with anymore
it works like a plunger
she had have_to throw it away
you could not play with it
that is not the reason
it is not glue
it has air
I surely do not
maybe he could keep two
stop throwing that
I do not talk to you like that
that is his nursery school teacher
get on the other side honey
you get on this side Diandra
I do not see your Daddy
close the door Diandra
I think I will sit down
I did not play it
you had it around my neck and you were playing it
you could shoot at anything that is set up for a target
I thought you asked her to play
now give the pens to Ursula
she needs pens for writing you know
David probably does not even play with those anymore
I ca not hold my hair up
you have_to be careful
you will break David's guitar
